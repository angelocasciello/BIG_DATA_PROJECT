Yes, try the dry rub ribs I couldn't get enough of it!! The best dry rub ribs I've had. The seasoning and moistness of the ribs were just fantastic. The green beans were surprisingly different from what I'm used to but it was really tasty and good and so were the beans for sides. We also tried the pulled pork nachos and was finger-licking good with all the cheese. Even their sweet tea was delicious.
There's street parking along the road. Go in and get in line (the entire time we were there, the line was out the door but its worth it!) There is a bar area and was able to catch some games on tv while we were there too as we're eating. It is crowded but table turnover is fast. 
The pictures don't do it enough justice. Go and try it, you won't be disappointed. If I ever go back to Nashville, I'd definitely eat here again!";14/01/2017 22:02

I ordered literally the exact same thing as before (pork belly plate with Brussels sprouts and corn bread), and my husband ordered the pepper jack bacon mac & cheese & the Cuban.
This time the service was 150% better than before! Water was refilled promptly, didn't tale forever to get the check or even talk to him, and food was out quickly!
The food is just as exceptional as before, although Brussels sprouts are a bit on the greasy side, but overall still delicious. Pork belly has that crispy sweet edges, and despite being a fatty cut, actually had a great ratio of meat to it! Portion size was also great for $12.

I know we didn't eat during the dinner rush so I can't truly say if the restaurant addressed my claims from before, but it looks like they at least tried and I'm quite happy!";07/12/2018 22:40
GgIH0ueMvNJj2bU4tPROOA;MMoQ22Aow5trC8GQROtNAw;_jRB9wKomaO1W3tfA1sX_Q;2;4;0;0;"I was excited to see a new Starr restaurant in the form of burritos open up in Philly. A year of pandemic has left me looking for a little change in take-out options. My partner and I ordered the salsa trio with chips, Baja shrimp burrito, and K-Town burrito. The packaging was very cute, but the food was unfortunately a flop.

Starting with the salsa trio ($6). Highly disappointing. The salsa verde was ok, just a little spicy but not much flavor. The pico de gallo was almost frozen solid, so that was a huge let down.. and then the salsa roja smelled and tasted extremely off. I couldn't put my finger on what I was tasting but it smelled like burning rubber. The chips were excellent though.. too bad there wasn't much use for them.

I thought the K-Town burrito ($14) was ok. It had Korean beef, kimchi, rice, refried beans, grilled scallions, lettuce. My partner, who is Korean, was extremely disappointed in the flavor. He disliked it so much he did not want to finish the burrito. We enjoy Korean fusion foods but he felt there was a bad aftertaste from the kimchi. There wasn't much meat in the burrito although it was hefty overall.

The Baja shrimp burrito ($14) was also ok. The fried shrimp was buffalo flavored which was fine, but I was expecting a different profile from the name ""Baja"". Nothing really stood out in the burrito, it was a little boring despite the description. 

All in all, a very expensive pair of basic burritos with nice names and packaging. We paid about $45 after tip and delivery. Part of me wants to try their mission style burrito or the frito pie, but this experience left me a little sad. :(";04/03/2021 01:51

It used to be a bank, so the architecture is awesome and super cool with the tall vaulted ceiling. I love their circling selections of fresh brewed ice tea, or you can pick from a ton of hot teas, and they have several options for coffees of various strengths as well. Baristas are always friendly and the service is pretty quick depensing on the technicality of the order in front of you!

They also have an awesome display of pastries, and they even make some awesome bagel sandwiches! I recommend the chocolate croissant or banana bread! Also, the upstairs is better for super quiet studying, but I prefer sitting outside and watching the hustle and bustle on Oak/Carrollton.

Maybe it's because I'm old and still assume a business should simply do what they say? I took my custom Harley to Mo Music because of the reviews and a personal reference. I had another dealer tell me it would be over $1k to do what Mo Music did for less than $500! My system sounded better then the day it was installed. What they did may not have been elaborate, but they didn't rip me off! This is SO important to me. I just want to patronize local businesses that do the right thing. Simple right? Nope! So many places want to churn and burn. Mo Music is the real deal! They do what's right and want to create lifetime customers. I for one will always take my business and refer others here!! Thank you Mo Music for being an awesome, reputable business!;28/08/2021 04:15

Trevi's menu and food quality is a big step above your average pizza / spaghetti place. I have been to Trevi many times and I think they achieve what they are trying to accomplish. Slightly fancier Italian fare with some standard favorites. I only have 1 complaint and unless you go here often, you probably won't notice.. The MUSIC. They have been playing the same Frank Sinatra ""Duets"" albums (the worst records ever released by the arguably greatest pop singer of all time) since they opened, on some kind of torturous loop. They also play the overly cliche' Italian / American novelty songs by Louis Prima and Lou Monte etc. Also on a loop. Be prepared to hear the same songs at least twice every hour you are there. I honestly don't know how the employees can stand hearing the same music looped day in and day out. I would honestly give them an extra star if not for the horrendous, repeated music.

OQr0hxwR3L39ZSkcqyfvYg;8L9oiV_vfDWI2y71EnbbbQ;LHfckMyH7hyS7l401mM4Lg;1;12;2;0;"Extremely concerned customer here.  For starters we originally put a $1000 down payment to reserve our model 3 back in April 2016.  Finally we were allowed to order the model 3 in August 2018 and they required an additional $2500 deposit, something we were not informed of.  We later learned that because we moved states that we would not be able to acquire Tesla financing and would have to go through other lenders which took some hoops but finally we got it done through USAA.  Because we couldn't get the invoice and get the taxes/registration calculation, we just took a loan out for $55,000 from USAA for the car.  The car ended up being $53,000 when we took delivery in early November 2018.  Customer service could not give us our difference in payment or refund our deposits.  We were informed it would take up to 6 weeks to get a refund and also we also to get the free supercharging for 6 months.  It's now almost 3 months later and we haven't gotten anything.  We've called Tesla of Devon multiple times who have given us a toll free number in California where there is not an option to get to a live person or the department you need, you wait on hold for hours and end up getting disconnected and our issue is still not resolved.

Finally I had it and asked to speak to the manager after Elliot notated my account.  I was then put in contact with the manager named Brian who has been helpful but is limited in what he can do because apparently all responsibility remains on Tesla HQ in California.  Ridiculous doesn't even begin to describe.  When we spoke he told me that HQ and the case manager (who I still can't get a name, number or email for) only had a record of us putting the $1000 in April 2016 and the overpayment when we picked up the vehicle in November 2018 and that we would only be getting a check for $2700 on January 16th unless WE PROVED THAT WE PAID THEM!!!  I gave them their TESLA  invoice number and was told that we had to get a copy of our credit card statement proving that we were charged the $2500 and that it could even then take further time to resolve us getting paid.  Here's an excerpt of his email:

""Hello again Kim, 

The issue of your $2500 not showing can only be some sort of computer error/glitch, or a matter of the payment never processing. Personally, I think it's an error. I agree that it's frustrating, but right now we can only deal with what facts we have, which is why I'm trying my best to get all the information that we can that proves that you paid the $2500 so that your refund can be processed without delay on the 16th. 

Regarding why you were never told about the issue, I wish I could answer that. When we submit refund cases here at Devon, that's usually the end of our involvement as all refunds are processed and paid by California. Now give that refunds usually take 2-3 months, I can only assume that someone from California would have contacted you soon, had you not contacted us first. But of course, after the fact I can't say anything more than my assumption. 

Again, I know this is frustrating, and I'm sorry to ask you to gather information like your credit card statement as proof, but right now that's the quickest option to try to ensure that you are refunded in full ASAP. I apologize for any inconvenience, we may never fully know why the payment isn't showing now unless California contacts you to explain when they know, but we can certainly do our best to correct it in the mean time at least.

I know it's not the answer you were hoping for.""

Our credit card company only keeps 4 months of statements and could not fax us a copy so we had to order one and wait for it to come in the mail to send to Brian. We did on January 12th and this was the reply I got.

""Hello Kim, 

I have contacted the case owner who was working on your refund via our company software and uploaded this credit card statement to the case. They should reach out to you directly regarding this, if not, hopefully to me and we can let you know when it is sorted. 

-Brian""

What hurts more is our family is one of the 800,000+ families currently affected by the government shutdown and for us to not get over $5000+ back on a refund and for Tesla to keep some of our monies essentially for years without interest, apology or any type of expedited remediation is just plain wrong.  

We even purchased $26,000 solar from this company and still no genuine assistance except hearing the California HQ blame game.  We remember purchasing a Toyota in California and getting a refund check 3 days later.  On top of this our car registration and taxes were due on January 8th and our refund check still hasn't come yet and we still have absolutely no idea of when it's coming and the company that messed up hasn't said, ""We're sorry"" or ""Let's give you something to make this right.""  How can the #1 car seller not get their act together or put their customers first?  Shame on you Tesla.";15/01/2019 14:23

Long story short, I ordered shrimp Alfredo with extra shrimp. Thank God I checked my to-go order, because what the waitress brought me was shrimp scampi. Two or three times she apologized to me saying it was her fault, it was her fault, it was her fault. Of course I accepted her apology but told her that I wasn't going to pay $27 for an order that my boyfriend would not eat. At that point the kitchen had closed. Her attitude immediately changed, and she said to me two or three times, "" okay I'll just have to pay it instead"".  Her friendly demeanor had changed, and she just kept repeating to me that she would just pay it instead, I guess to make me feel guilty. I still tipped her, but although I have been coming to the Casual clam for probably 15 years, and have been bringing out of town guests here also, I do believe in the future I am going to rethink visiting here. Her mistake in putting in the order should not have been blamed on me. I ended up having to go somewhere else, Outback, as most restaurants in the area had closed at 9 p.m..

For food, we enjoyed the poke bowl, a salad, and some tacos. The poke bowl should probably be called a poke cup because it was kind of hard to get a good bite without spilling the rest. 

The salad was awesome! So fresh and such a nice presentation. If you add a protein it could honestly be your entree for the night. 

Tacos for the most part were enjoyable but they actually brought them out first before we even got the wine.

Everyone in our party started with a cup of seafood gumbo as their appetizer. And it was a hit! The roux was rich and on point. Each cup had a random sampling of shrimp, crawfish, oysters, and crabmeat. Bravo, five stars for the gumbo! 

Three members of our party chose fried seafood plates. Papa ordered the fried oyster plate and said the oysters were delicious. Jenny ordered the fried shrimp and the shrimp were huge. And Henry ordered the fried fish and his plate was stacked high with fried fish. Everyone loved their seafood and the seasoned batter was tasty. The generous portion of hot French fries were a perfect accompaniment.

Linh ordered the traditional oyster po-boy. It was ""dressed"" in New Orleans fashion (lettuce, tomatoes, pickles), and it didn't disappoint.

Paula ordered the Italian Combo po-boy. She thought it was interesting that the meatballs and sausage were sliced. She said the sandwich was delicious.

I ordered the ham and roast beef sandwich. It was very good, but could have use a little more roast beef gravy. It is a big sandwich. I ordered the half sandwich and could only finish half of it.

Drinks- Long Island was on point.

I was really excited to show off this restaurant because he'd never been there and every time I'd eaten there before the pandemic it had been great. We were sat on the patio and we were not even greeted for 20 minutes until I went to find the hostess and ask her to send the server. As the evening progressed I realized other tables getting the same treatment so it's likely the restaurant was very under-staffed. There seemed to be some manager intervention outside assisting with drink orders so they seemed like they were trying to get on top of it, but that night they bit off more than they could chew. I ordered the oysters and they were great and came out relatively quickly, as did the wine once we ordered drinks. I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat so I held off on ordering and my boyfriend ordered the burger which also came out timely and was delicious. When I did order I ordered the tuna tartare and it took so long to come out and when it did the tuna steak came out by mistake so I had to send it back... they quickly reconciled the bill and I believe they even gave me my first glass of wine for free because of the time it took to get greeted. I will be back because I've had other nice experiences here but I hope this restaurant isn't being mismanaged as other recent poor reviews might suggest.;08/08/2021 17:11

I order their signature lobster roll which comes with a bag of chips (~$20).  They have the 4oz option and the 6oz option for the lobster roll, I ordered the 4oz and the lobster overflowed out of the roll.  I could only imagine how full the 6oz. would be since the roll size remains the same regardless of how much lobster meat you order.  The lobster roll was DELICIOUS!!!  The meat was abundant and there wasn't any fillers.  Just some type of butter sauce.  As traditional lobster rolls the meat was chilled but not cold or frozen, but perfect.  The roll was lightly toasted and soft with a bit of mayo.  The chips were a nice add BUT as others mentioned I wasn't full after that meal which was the only drawback.

During this pandemic, I completely understand potential staffing issues, or even less than stellar customer service. We are all human. With that said, this place would do better being closed than open. The staff is surly to say the least. Hell, I even left a generous tip for the employee who took my order for over priced shitty food, even though she was clearly annoyed by my existence. There is so much potential here that is being wasted. The owners would fair better at shutting it down now or replacing staff before it gets even worse. The only saving grace was the kind and clearly embarrassed woman who worked at the pizza place in the building. She isn't even a staff member of the bowling alley, yet still apologized profusely on their behalf. That should tell you something. 

Also, a friend of mine wasn't going to bowl because of a bad back. The cranky old bastard in charge of the shoes was quick to tell us that he has called the police on people in the past for not wearing shoes. Yep. So she paid to rent shoes to not bowl...sigh. 

The gaming area looked so fun. Until it took my girlfriend's money without being able to play a single game. You can guess how helpful good ole cranky was. At this point, it was almost comical.

In conclusion, there is so much potential, but the staff is destroying this business. Be warned and bowl elsewhere.";28/01/2021 23:58

Parking is awful, even if you pay for a spot, other tenants tend to take your spot and you are stuck calling the main office and then they tell you to park in a different parking space (now you're taking the spot of someone else).  ALSO, they gave a permit for my parking spot to someone else! For some reason, without my consent or knowing, gave another tenant my parking spot for free while I was still paying for it and living there trying to use my own parking spot. They add additional charges wherever they can. At the end it's not worth fighting the additional 25.00 here and there and I ended up just paying them. Just counting the days till my lease was up. I was charged $25 for a missing gate key, that I had turned in upon moving out. I handed in all of my keys and they put it in a little baggy and somehow they lost it, blaming me for losing it and therefore charging me. Ridiculous. Glad I won't be coming back to such a trashy place. The 20 year olds are jokes and all they do is socialize in the office and don't tend to the needs of the tenants.

If you are a student as myself that really just wanted a clean place to live and study, then this is not the place for you....parties every weekend is not what I signed up for.
Drugs and alcohol are always welcomed at Beach City and if that's your thing then this is the perfect place to live for you. I won't be renewing my lease, done giving them extra money.

Dr. Riggan and his nurses Theresa and his triage nurse Amanda/Mandy are still the best, truly wonderful people. Love Dr. Riggan so much, best doctor ever. So my stars are for all of them. But the actual office and office staff? Jesus take the wheel! In the last 6 months it's become a complete and utter hot mess. I had been hearing this from friends for awhile but have been able to shrug it off. Now that I'm there for pregnancy though? No shrugging it off. On a Tuesday there was no office manager or assistant manager available, I still haven't gotten a call back from the billing department 6 months later, several staff are showing the stress with rudeness and major attitude. Patient restrooms are sometimes a disaster with no Ob wipes, no urine sample cups or toilet paper (2 occasions recently). They almost never pick up the phone anymore. As a result messages to various departments are ignored and go unreturned repeatedly. And forget surgery/ob scheduling ever knowing what scheduling is doing and so good luck getting in for your early scheduled OB appointments, mine got pushed out further and then rescheduled to accommodate surgery changes the day of my appointment. They then acted like they were doing me a huge favor when they split up my 3 appointments the day of said appointments, and canceling my first as I arrived in the parking lot?! To accommodate surgery because of their lack of communication between departments. And ultrasound? The ultrasound department doesn't know what anyone else is doing and sometimes not even what they are suppose to be doing. And referrals? Still waiting weeks later and so I'll miss out on recommended testing because my window is swiftly closing because they could not be bothered to make my appointment. It it wasn't for knowing that my doctor was one of the best in the area and how crappy the others are at the neighboring practice I would be long gone like several of my friends.

She's crazy knowledgeable with the color she uses also, and isn't afraid to suggest new tones or placement of foils.

I knew I did not pay a high price and did not expect a luxury room; however, this was all pretty off-putting.  It got even worse when later that evening we found blood on the sheets!!!!!  I called the front desk completely outraged and even said, ""I am so disgusted that I don't want to even stay here"".  He VERY RUDELY replied with no problem, you can leave and we will refund you.  I was appalled.  There was no apology whatsoever or offer of correcting the problem.  I got very testy with him and explained my daughter had an early morning event and I needed some resolution.  He then, still in that rude tone, offered to have housekeeping come in and change the sheets.  In the interim, the woman who checked me in called my room and explained she was sorry for the inconvenience and that she would work on resolving this with finding a new room or sending housekeeping. I could not believe this was all happening!!!  When housekeeping FINALLY came - about 15-20 minutes later she saw the stain and insisted it was paint (nail polish).  I became very angry and explained that I had spilled nail polish on my sheets before and that it was NOT nail polish.  When you attempt to wash nail polish it remains hard on the sheet.  The crazy part was that there was simply no attempt to make this ugly situation better.  There was argument and defense from every corner.  The truth was that even if it was wine / food stain, WHICH IS WAS NOT, the sheet should have NEVER, EVER been used!!!  Needless to say, I would NOT recommend this motel at all!!!

They did not even offer a refund for my stay there!!!!!";05/03/2017 23:18

Usually the food is good, but tonight was not their night. We phoned in our order for takeout. It took them almost an hour and a half to make our order. Then when we got the food home, the order was wrong and the food almost inedible. Ordered steak nachos and received chicken nachos. We ordered a chicken Caesar salad and the chicken was so overcooked that it was impossible to chew. We wound up throwing it out and just eating the Caesar salad without the chicken. We ordered chicken tenders fir our daughter, but by the time we picked up the order, the fries were cold and soggy. We'll come back for the beer, but will likely give the food a miss.;10/09/2021 03:25

I was searching yesterday on Open Table to see who had a reservation available for 7-7:15ish pm. Chappy's came up so my  husband and I did a little research online via Yelp and Open Table reviews. The reviews were pretty favorable overall so we decided to give it a try. I had read that people go here for special occasions, so my husband and I ditched our jeans for nicer clothes. Oops. 

I immediately judged the place when I walked in. The carpet, yes carpet, was completely stained. The lights were bright and the decor just awful. Completely awful. The hostess was no where to be seen and we were fourth in line waiting to be helped. About 5-10 minutes after we walked in the door the hostess finally greeted us and sat us for our 7:15 reservation. As we walked to our table the hostess noticed she had forgotten to give us Mardi Gras beads. What? Yes, this place gives you Mardi Gras beads to wear when you enter. It's just that cheesy. 

Once we sat down I told my husband we could leave. Really. Suzie Wong's House of Yum is just down the street and I would gladly get up and go down there for dinner. We decided to stay put and see what this place was like. Hmm... kind of wish we would have left. 

For dinner I ordered the Grilled Red Snapper and a side salad. The salad was decent and just your run of the mill side salad. I was very surprised the salad dressing came out in a plastic ramekin. At $29 for my entree I was not expecting a plastic ramekin. Wow. My dinner was actually okay. Although it was served on a dirty plate. The ""dirt"" was from my dish, but the server/manager should have wiped it clean before it left the kitchen. It was luke warm and not hot, but overall the fish which was topped with crab meat was good. The rice was nothing to write home about.

Other things I noticed: 
a) Water damage to the wall close to the ceiling. It had been painted over and not fixed.  
b) There were a lot of older people dining here. I'm talking late 40s+. 
c) The carpet is stained everywhere, not just at the entryway.
d) The only thing really cajun about this place is the fact they offer things blackened. 

Net: My husband is thinking about nominating this place for Kitchen Nightmares.";28/02/2011 00:04

As you approach from the outside, you notice the once vibrant and now weathered yellow and red paint job. Warped wood outlines single pane windows.  This cafe, maybe once vibrant, looks old and tired ... much like the service. Don't expect a quick in and out experience. A simple order of a grilled cheese sandwich and a philly steak pushed our limits as these basic sandwiches took well over 40 minutes to arrive at our booth on a sleepy Saturday.  I watched our server slowly trudge back and forth without any sense of purpose or urgency, trying to look busy, while with each pass I was hoping she'd arrive with our lunch. When it finally arrived I was not disappointed. I expected a luke warm sammich without much flavor. I was wrong. The philly steak was satisfying and is classic comfort food. The grilled cheese looked equally as ""comforty"" and is served on two thick slices of Texas Toast, with a heaping mound of well prepared fries.  Overall, I'd return.

My favorite rolls are the tidal wave, thriller and crunchy red - although you truly can't go wrong. They all taste fresh and have interesting unique combinations. The crispy brussels or the shishito peppers are definitely the best apps I've tried. Both are light enough that you'll still be hungry for sushi, but also satisfying! For dessert, the chocolate spring rolls are a must! Unique and chocolatey, crunchy and light all at the same time. YUM!

The fried rice was cooked perfectly with plenty of vegetables. It tasted amazing by itself and they gave me a big portion. I also enjoyed mixing the fried rice with my chicken. The chicken I tried was Kanpunggi which is meat in a sweet & spicy sauce. It did come with plain white rice, but I always buy fried rice. The breaded chicken pieces were covered in a delicious sauce that gave them a vibrant color. The outside of the chicken was still crispy.

Most breakfast fare (outside of a good poached egg) is pretty simple to make on your own, and you don't have to bug the waiter to get your bacon extra crispy (or extra soggy, if you prefer.)  But when the opportunity came up to finally attend an event with some fellow Boise Yelpers, I had to jump on it and head over to Moe Joe's.  So I just want to take a quick second to thank Ophelia for organizing, and getting the chance to meet everyone else who attended the ""Breakfast Club"" event! :)

That said, I have to start off with some negatives.  Moe Joe's really isn't set up to handle a large group like we had.  Despite having made prior arrangements for the event, it still took about 20 minutes after our prescribed time before we were seated.  I understand not every restaurant is equipped to handle a dozen people at once, but I have to say Moe Joe's kind of dropped the ball on this one.  I'd still recommend the place for a casual breakfast by yourself or a friend, but if you're bringing the whole office or something... I'd say ""pass.""

The food itself was well worth it though.  The cinnamon rolls (thanks again Ophelia) were as good as advertised.  My son plowed through most of the one we ""shared"" although I did get a bite or two.  The coffee was good, better than your usual ""diner"" fare, and refills were prompt and plentiful.  I got the Enchilada Chicken Stacker for my entree, and I enjoyed it... good portion size, good flavor.  The only ""complaint"" would be that I think I wanted more of that yummy cream sauce.  That was good stuff.

Bottom line folks, if you're looking for breakfast in Meridian, Moe Joe's will fill the bill.  Just don't plan a family reunion brunch there. :P";30/05/2015 18:17

The toppings were fresh and generous but the crust was a bit thick and doughy for our liking (NY pizza snobs, we are). However, that said, we crisped it up a few nights later (400 for 15 minutes), and that did the trick. Their pastries looked wonderful but a bit too rich for my palette I think, though I almost got a couple of biscotti because they looked absolutely like you'd find in NYC's Little Italy. But, alas it was still Lent, so I passed.
Good pie. Fair price. Don't know why ANYONE would not try this place, it's as good as you're likely to get in the area.";05/04/2021 21:22

dngVdjhsbRVJg-L5RKr8hw;5jlydBxYlYo7-A7AIMdBtQ;#NOME?;2;2;0;1;"So this is my once every 5 year best friend argument.  You know, that argument you have with your best friend every few years that makes you wonder why you're friends in the first place.  Then a week or so goes by and you realize it's only natural, and it's OK not to see eye to eye on everything!  I forgive you Yelp and I'm not going to throw away years of loyal friendship because you were dead WRONG about this place.  First off, we were asked if we had reservations for lunch in a restaurant that was half empty.  The outside dining area was 80% empty and we were seated there within a few minutes.  Water was brought to the table immediately, but we waited for at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even greet us.  And by greet I mean, come over and ask if we were ready to order when we didn't even have menus yet.  He didn't introduce himself, mention any specials or crack a smile. (under a mask that was half off his face)

We ordered a prosciutto plate which was fairly dry with some wilted greens.  I had the spaghetti carbonara which was fine, nothing special and a ricotta cheesecake which was OK too.  I don't remember anything much about the meal except I ate it with little interest other than hunger and I was paying for it.  The prices were extremely high for the quality, but the kicker was the poor service.  I think our waiter checked on us once, until I had to call him for the check.  But wait, there's more!  As he walked away and saw I only tipped 15%, I saw him shaking his head and say, ""come on people"". The effing nerve! 

Now remember, I tipped 15% because it's the decent thing to do.  Even if I get bad service, I still tip 15%, I just won't go back to that establishment.  I normally tip 20% for good service and  25% for excellent service.  I did this even before Corona because people are working hard for their money, most times.  His entitlement was the only thing that shined during the encounter and that was proven by his reaction to a standard tip.  I have no sympathy for people who dial it in at work, put no effort and expect optimal results.  All this coupled with mediocre food qualifies for a 2 star rating. I understand I'm an outlier here, but it was what it was.";14/08/2021 03:30

If you don't live here, you might be asking yourself, ""But why is this brave?"" Until you've played the roulette with any kind of Asian food here, just trust me, it's not a game you often win.
However, there I was walking into Maru with high hopes and a hungry tummy. 
It all started the day prior when I chanced an Uber Eats order with them of their veggie udon and veggie tempura, and even though I'm 99% sure I accidentally dumped the tempura dipping sauce into the noodles along with the actual broth, it was somehow still good???
Anyways, I digress. Maru. Go there. 
My partner and I both ordered ramen, and neither disappointed. I went with my go-to tankatsu which was as fatty and delicious as it should be. My partner got the butter mushroom ramen and WOW. Rich. Delicious. Actually a decent amount of mushrooms. Both were winners 100%. 
The takoyaki, which is another thing I'm chronically afraid to chance, were perfect and didn't burn the living hell out of my mouth. 
And of course I also had to try an origiri because they're hard to find here y'all. I tried the pork. It was perfection. I'm finishing it right now for lunch.

When family arrived, there was no room reserved for them and they were advised to go to the other LaQuinta close by.  A couple days later i discovered a charge on MY CREDIT CARD for the cost of the room that was never used.  (the same thing happened last year, but too much trouble to pursue at the time-not this time). After returning I went to inquire about the missed reservation and was told it was reserved in my name.  After some resistance and misunderstanding on part of the desk clerk, she finally acknowledged that the error was hers, she submitted the refund and was told my account would be credited within 48 hours.  That was 6 days ago and I haven't gotten the refund yet.  Suffice to say I won't be recommending this motel again - two errors in two tries.  When I made the reservation on a Sunday afternoon, I asked for a confirmation.  He handed me a hand-written number on a piece of note paper.  There as another lady, whom I won't name, working the desk with him.  The date was 2/4 for a 2/5 reservation.  There are plenty of suitable lodging locations in the area.  In case anybody wants to know, I will be contacting the home office with my concern.  The refund invoice number is 249180, supposedly processed on 2/19/18.  Any business can provide a clean bed, TV, continental breakfast, etc.  It's the little things, the attention to detail, that keep customers coming back.  La Quinta was my family's choice of lodging.

Like most of the other great cheesesteak places, this is a very small spot with limited counter seating. They also have a walk-up window though, where you can more easily place your order and take it go quickly.

Given that the sign out front and the menu touted that they had the original Chicken Cheesesteak, and that I was eating enough red meat in two days for a month, I decided to try the Chicken version for the first time ($9).

I got it like a good Cheesesteak should be, with fried onions and American cheese, and it was really excellent, overflowing with a ton of juicy, chopped up cubes of chicken.

This is a great option for Cheesesteaks in the area. You probably want to try Jim's at least once for comparison's sake and to see what all the hype is about, but come here for high quality cheesesteaks and a fraction of the wait time.";07/11/2013 23:54

When we arrived, the hotel was packed. The room my child and I were given smelled of animal urin and cleaner. I requested a new room due to the fact that I began to get an allergy attack. I was given attitude and reluctantly give a new room.

The second room that we were placed in was filthy, dust build up on the head boards of the beds, the electrical outlet in the room was falling out of the wall, the a/c didnt cool the air, the phones didn't work, and the cable t.v. didnt work until the last night and the bathroom sink was plugged up. (I have photos if anyone would care to see them)

What made it worse was on Saturday we went to go out and my child left a dental retainer in a cup of water soaking by our tooth brushes on the bathroom coutner. When we returned, we found that the housekeepers threw it away. I immediatly went to the front desk and spoke to Melissa, who told me that she would call the housekeeping manager. I waited at the front desk for about a half an hour and the manager did not show up. Melissa told me that she would have him call me and took my cell number. He never called. I went back to the front desk about two hours later and again was told that someone would call me, but that the general manager of the hotel was off work until Wed.

I went up to the front desk again on Sunday and was again told that someone would call me... I asked how long would I have to wait as I had reported it Saturday, the day before, and no one has called. I was assured that the manager would call me when he came in for work.

I spent good money for my vacation and now have to spend another $500.00 dollars to replace the dental retainers. 

The hotel never let me file any sort of claim, and never gave me the name or phone number of the manager or general manager. Their customer service was the worst that I have ever received and their rude manner and indifferance over my childs retainer being thrown away by the housekeeper was reprehensable.

 I am appalled and will also be filing a report with the BBB and who ever else oversees the hospitality trade.

I will never return to this hotel or refer it to anyone.";19/06/2012 01:43

My brother and his kids spent two nights in the hotel as well (in their own room). My nephew wanted to sleep in my room with his cousin one night. My nephew wet the bed in the middle of the night. When I woke up and discovered what had happened, I immediately stripped the bed. There is a mattress protector on the bed, and that was wet as well. I tried to take it off, but it was zip tied on. I called housekeeping around 6am and let them know what had happened and requested that someone come and remove the cover and change the sheets. I reminded the front desk of my request around 1pm, as it had not been taken care of yet. Around 6pm, it still had not been taken care. I called the front desk again and said if someone would just come take the cover off and bring me sheets I would make the bed myself. Someone came up and handed me sheets and then started to leave. I told her I needed the mattress cover removed. She went over to the bed and started to make it. I stopped her and said the mattress protector needed to be taken off. She explained that she didn't speak much English. I tried to explain what was needed, and she said she had to talk to a supervisor. She left. A few minutes later, the front desk calls and says that the mattress protector can only be removed by maintenance, and they won't be in until 6am the next morning. I explain that there is only a zip tie holding it on, and she said only maintenance can remove them. She repeated that they would be in the next morning. I explained to her that there was per on the bed, and we needed to sleep on it. She stated that my only other option was to switch rooms. I'm sorry, what??  You really can't change this sheet, so now I have to move rooms with 3 little kids?  I was told that was my only option. Because we needed the bed, I had to switch rooms. The new room was on a completely different floor. It was a huge inconvenience, and took at least an hour and a half out of the time I was supposed to be spending visiting with my friend. No one offered any help with our move or any other form of compensation for this huge inconvenience. I find it ridiculous that there was no way to remove this mattress cover. I can't be the first person to stay there who has had a child wet the bed. What would they have done if the hotel was full and they couldn't find us a new room?

The first time we tried this place, we couldn't get in after standing outside in the rain for hours.

We didn't go online to get tickets because you really need to do that on Mondays from what I understand...and they sell out super fast due to limited number of seats.

But, this time we actually were able to get inside. we ate, drank, and enjoyed the ""in the round"" music. It was very enjoyable. The food was ""okay""...nothing great and ditto on the drinks. But, we had fun and enjoyed our PACKED (yes, it was crammed inside) show.

For people who are coming in from out of town (like ourselves), expect to stand in line outside in whatever type of weather it happens to be that evening, and if you are lucky enough to get inside for a show, then plan to be packed in every seat. However, the staff handles the capacity pretty well once you're inside.

I still feel that the owners and staff could do so much more to make the events more enjoyable and less stressful for the customers. They need to get on top of their notoriety that the Nashville show has given them and get some help with crowds.

Truly, finding Skin Harmonics has been the biggest blessing, and I am forever grateful!! I was struggling with intense breakouts + trying to be proactive about anti-aging. This resulted in getting stuck in a Sephora hamster wheel, completely trapped into trying new products only to find that my acne was getting worse and ""clean"" anti-aging products began giving me dark spots around my eyes. I tried more and more products, diet changes, supplements, everything... hoping to find a solution. It felt completely hopeless.
At start of quarantine, my skin began breaking out like never before. Cystic pimples that were painful, embarrassing, and to be hones completely consuming. I tried everything and my skin seemed to only be getting worse. I'd spent hours researching ingredients in products + skin care, and continued to be let down. 

When I stumbled upon Skin Harmonics on Yelp (so random), the reviews seemed promising and I figured I'd give this a shot. Obviously, nothing else was working. I called Danny and we had an initial consult. She painted a clear picture our skin operates, and promised me that my skin would clear up. To my disbelieve, she kept that promise... Magic worker!

Starting the process was not glamorous with the extraction facial, but absolutely worth it. Without a doubt. 

I received my recommended Skin Harmonics products after my initial consult (the re-usable glass packaging is amazing btw).
 She then recommended: 
1- Use the products morning + night. She warned me my skin would purge 
as I adjusted to the products for two weeks (which I was already breaking out constantly so it wasn't out of the ordinary).
2- The facial. Danny explained the extraction would be intense and that the next could days I would need to lay low and let my skin heal. She was right, it definitely was painful, but satisfying at the same time knowing that years of reoccurring clogged pores were finally having their break through. It was pretty insane, looking back on how much my face had stored through the years. Yikes! ... so yes. worth it.
3. Recovery + self care. I stayed out of the sun and avoided makeup for the few days after the facial. I used only Skin Harmonics products and let my face heal.

Now..... 
My skin is now the absolute best it has ever looked!!! Blown away. I am never going back to the Sephora trap!! Danny's products are all that I need, literally. My breakouts are gone and the anti-aging ingredients in the products are incredible. I feel like a new woman and cannot imagine if I hadn't found Skin Harmonics. So much gratitude. 

Skin Harmonics is an ABSOLUTE MUST!!! Thank you for changing my life... Unreal results. Seriously, I cannot say enough good things. Danny has gone above and beyond, even has given me advice on my boyfriend's skin issues (as he's stubborn and won't deal haha). She is on your team and I 100% recommend Skin Harmonics to everyone. The best investment you could make for your physical self. 

... This is NOT an ad. I am truly blown away and hope everyone has the chance to work with Danny.";30/10/2020 03:15

I ordered a burger that was honestly embarrassing that they would serve it.  The patties looked like such poor quality that they didn't even resemble ground beef.

The reason this is so is because I have now been here 3 times and the first 2 times were pretty good the 3rd was atrocious. The first time I went it was to grab a quick bite with a girlfriend after our work out. We got the Edamame with the garlic lime topping as our appetizer and omg these are amazing!!! I highly recommend them. For my entree I chose the Buenos Aires bowl as it sounded as the most delicious to me and it did not have beans (which I am not a fan of). I instantly fell in love with this bowl! All the flavor! omg! I got it with the coconut avocado rice as my base and blackened chicken as my protein. After that first time I could not wait to go back and grab another bowl, so I did. I went back for a late lunch with another girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon at about 3pm. Again I had the edamame appetizer and I ordered the Buenos Aires bowl as my entree, this time I had a Michelob ultra with my meal (yes they have a beer selection + a craft soda machine). Again everything was great, food was delicious, service was fine, nothing crazy! 

Well fast forward to this past weekend when I finally got honey to bring me to this establishment after raving about how great it was. We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and were promptly seated by the kind hostess. The restaurant was not too busy maybe about 6 or 7 tables and it seemed they had quite a bit of servers/staff. It just so happened we had made it in time for Happy hour, this meant discounts on bowls and drinks! Our server quickly came over, introduced herself and took our drink orders. Honey just ordered water and I got a white sangria. This is when thing started to go down hill. I am pretty sure I received a mimosa in a wine glass the way one would serve sangria, either that or there was a ton of orange juice in my white sangria. I let it slide... Our waitress is now ready to take our order, I excitedly state I would like the Buenos Aires bowl when she tells me they are out. I am very annoyed at this point because this bowl is honestly the only reason I chose to come to this establishment on a Saturday afternoon. I figured it's not the waitresses fault and just suck it up, happy I did because shortly after she stated a patron the day before was very upset they did not have the bowl. I then asked her to recommend another bowl that is similar, she recommended the fajita bowl stating it was basically the same and that they could provide the chimichurri sauce that comes with the Buenos Aires. After looking at the menu it is very apparent these bowls are not ""basically the same bowl"" and in fact this bowl contains beans, after expressing my disdain for beans she stated the can came sure to not include them. Great! This is not what  came here for but heck I am trying something new. Honey ordered some other bowl which he did say he enjoyed. Well our bowls come out and wouldn't you know it mine is covered in beans. As I wait for our server to come back around (trying to make eye contact) I tell honey to go on and start eating his food, he wants to wait a bit. Our server comes over and i explain the issue, she apologizes and says they will remake it and it will be right out. Waiting, waiting, waiting... I tell honey to eat his food. He begins to eat and I can tell he is trying to take his time. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Honey is done with his dish. Waiting, waiting, waiting, hostess happens to be walking by and ask if everything is okay, at this point I tell her it is not and that we just want our check and we will be leaving. She noticed honey had finished his dish and we had finished our drink and I still did not have my food. Finally my dish appears as I am waiting for the check. I tell the person that brought it out that I am okay I will just take my check. At this point I had already decided and told honey I would just get a Chipotle bowl and eat it at home. Honey is very patient and was a server back in the day he was the reason I was patient so long--- but it got to the point where even he was like ""this is ridiculous"" and agreed I'm better off just grabbing a bowl at Chipotle. The only thing we can assume is that they put my ticket in for a new bowl as if a new customer had walked in?!?!?!?!? Why was my ticket not cut in line and my dish rectified in a more expedient manner? Beyond me! Anyhow they packaged my meal to go and out 2 cookies in the bag, I appreciated the gesture but I was so upset I was ready to get out of there and we did. We paid our tab and they had removed my bowl which was kind. When I got home and ate my bowl I was disappointed. It was not ""basically the same bowl"" very different and just not as good even with adding the chimichurri sauce they gave me on the side. 

All in all many mistakes where made! How do you run out of the Buenos Aires bowl? How does it take longer to correct a bowl than it did to initially make it? Just make another!";07/06/2019 14:05

The amount of pressure to stay afloat when most people aren't leaving their homes must be intense, but to go ahead and OPEN a new business during these rough economic times takes perhaps the biggest set of balls that have ever existed. This is exactly what the guys at Heights Meat Market (new Brandon/Bloomingdale Ave. location) have done, essentially extending their middle fingers to the virus, pushing their chips to the middle of the table, and betting all-in that the Brandon community will flock to their new store to devour their vast selection of meat and specialty game. 
        Truth be told, I visited this new location on a whim as I was actually cutting through back roads to avoid traffic on Bell Shoals and Bloomingdale when the buddy I was with mentioned that they read somewhere that this new store had just opened a couple of months ago and that we should check it out because they'd heard that their Seminole Heights location had a great reputation. Since I'm a sucker for checking out new places, I quickly jotted into the adjoining parking lot next to the auto parts store where this new establishment now resides, and we ventured inside. 
         I've never been to any of their other stores (Seminole Heights and Land O' Lakes), so I don't know what exactly the layout is supposed to look like, but I have to admit that the inside looked a little underwhelming (you can make your own assumptions based on the pictures I took attached to this review).  Perhaps things were more spread out due to virus regulations, but it was basically about 14-15 freezer cases that had signs atop each one describing the proteins that were inside each one. But seriously, who cares, it's all about the product that they provide and based on that notion, this is where my dilemma makes my way into this story. 
        I didn't actually purchase anything, so my review is really about getting this particular store on the YELP map (I noticed no one had reviewed the place yet, so I wanted to help them out). The guys in the store (I'm pretty sure were the owners) were extremely nice and friendly, and did a great job describing everything in the store and answering all of the multitude of questions that people had. I would have gone 5 stars based on my overall experience, but I just have one gripe (which is really just my own personal issue) and that is that they outsource all of their meats from out of town (other states). I'm probably just getting old and cranky, but when I think meat market I envision the old school butchers that are still wearing their bloody aprons from cutting up their meat in the back when they come out to the counter to help you, but I digress. 
          Per my earlier comments, this review was really an attempt to help get butts in the door for these fine folks, so my promise to them is that I will do a follow up review after I've actually purchased and eaten their delectable looking meats, and then give some quality feedback. Until then my fellow Brandonites, go check this place out and let me know what YOU think, and make sure to continue to support local businesses like these guys, they all need are help in these crappy times";19/09/2020 00:00

I was lured by some excellent happy hour pricing that included an extensive martini list with many many choices from five to twelve dollars.

Service was not too fast which was a good thing as my wife and I had to work our way around the drink menu to find exactly what we wanted. A place that attempts to have something for everyone deserves some credit but of course that can lead to menu paralysis.

There was a piano player in the lounge and the lights are low. If you need a place to unwind from the hustle and bustle of downtown Reno, stop in for a drink or two!";18/07/2018 23:58
swueYMVCvFvODZ0Vhrediw;aFEvgTu0TZxvdpcY27LEiw;FEXhWNCMkv22qG04E83Qjg;4;1;0;1;Overdue on this review! We loved New Orleans! My mother in law insisted we come here for some beignets. Delicious, tons of powdered sugar ( definitely satisfied my sweet tooth ) and good coffee! I don't blame the ladies in the window for rushing or anything since lines were long as this was a VERY popular spot. Their seating is outdoors and is per friendly but because it's so crowded and honestly we weren't in the mood to wait for an open table, we sat on the benches nearby which no one was really taking advantage of? I get the hype from the name and the food was definitely there to back it up. It's CASH ONLY, and they have souvenir mugs for sale (black/white logo or colored) and you can choose to have your café au lait served in it or in a regular to-go coffee cup. Good experience! Glad to be able to say we've had beignets from Café Du Monde.;23/02/2020 03:06

I go here and support them as much as I can. The cashiers and workers are always knowledgeable and willing to help. It's conveniently located right on Baltimore Ave and generally you can find parking if need be. They also have the highest quality food available as well as cheaper low end food if needed. They also have supplies for neonatal kittens, which has come in handy for myself as a foster parent.

If you ask, he thoroughly explains the details so you know what you're paying for. For mine, it was $5 for battery and $2 for pins. He fixed my watch as good as new. The band was completely detached from the case. If you're worried about getting ripped off, seriously, don't. I tried to give this map some tip, but didn't take any. The quote I got from Michael Kors was over $50. Definitely save your money and go to George!!! He puts his initials inside the watch. In case anything were to happen, you can go back and ask him to fix it again.

But most of the time I eat here for lunch, and it hits the spot. I love getting their wonton pho with chicken broth. It's usually not too salty, and that's something I appreciate.

They offer happy hour specials from 4-7 in their lounge and at their bar. We snagged the two remaining seats at the bar when we walked in. Despite the limited seating, the ambiance was wonderful and reminded me of the Great Gatsby. Their happy hour menu was one of the best in Philly- with beer, wine, and cocktails costing only $5. Both my friend and I ordered the Pear Necessities, which had flavors of sweet tea, maple, and pear. We opted to converse at the bar for upwards of two hours after finishing our beverages and the bartender only checked on us once to ensure we were satisfied. Additionally, we tried to flag down the bartender for our check for 20 minutes. Overall, I would rate the ambiance and menu high, however, I was not impressed with the service.;22/02/2020 13:17

I asked her to not be rude to me, as I would not be rude to her when it came to teaching her about my profession. They then proceeded to attempt to do my nails, and charge me 10 extra dollars from what they normally do, when I got the same design as a time before. They solidify you as a  customer, they give you a great price and then when you return the price is drastically increased for half the job of what you got initially. They have no price menu specifically for that reason. They don't provide refunds or re-do & bad mouth you in their native language when you request too much of them. Lisa who is the owner bad mouthed me to a friend who she did not realize I knew and made racist comments about me to her. Lisa (the owner) is the one who runs things and is super entitled.

We ordered the caprese appetizer, which was very good. I am a sucker for fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. Wish there was a little less salt and some balsamic, but it was good.  Both our entrees were very good. I had a eggplant dish, which was almost like a lasagna. Came with a side of pasta, which they give you several noodle options. For an extra $1 you can get gnocchi.

The placemats on the table show historical and travel information about the Hue province of Vietnam as well as the city of Hue.  I did taste a slight difference in the flavorings of the food, but not much difference in the menu offerings.  The décor is quaint, clean, and well organized.  There is not much to see from the outside, and you can forget about seeing inside from the road.  This is mostly seen with the table's utensil and condiment offerings on all tables.  From the clientele, it has to be authentic.

We started off with the Goi Cuon ($3.00), two large fresh rolls filled with the usual items.  But, these were much larger and tastier than I am used to.  There is a lemongrass flavor on the shrimp and there are also crispy fried onions- a great flavor.  Muc Chein Don ($10.95) was an appetizer of fried squid rings on a fresh bed of salad, served with a side of unusual sauce.  The sauce was like garlic, ketchup, and pinapple used for dipping the squid.  This was a very large portion for an appetizer, which would explain the price.

The Pho Tai (large $7.95) was a heavy bowl of flavorful broth.  Some in Tampa say that it is the best in the city, served here.  While it is very salty, beefy, and full of flavor- I would not say it is better than Pho Quyen on Hillsborough.  It is sad that they do not offer flank steak with meatballs.  Only meatballs on their own.  The Special Rice Plate (Com $8.50) was pretty average in offerings.  The mixed omelet was dry, the fried egg was excellent (over easy), and the grilled pork had an interesting (yet delicious) flavor.  

We were too full to order Che Ba Mau, which they had on display in the large cooler.  Note that you are served iced green tea here for free, so there is no reason to order a drink.  They do not have a fountain, so it is only per can for soda and coconut juice.

The best part about this place is the Free meal you get on your birthday! You can get breakfast, or lunch at any price on the menu. So take advantage of that if you're in the area on your birthday.

The food has been good to me aside from my latest visit where my sons potatoes were served black and burnt to the crisp! I wanted to send them back but he taste tested them and surprisingly said they were good. But really guys who serves potatoes that burnt to customers?? C'mon now! 

Aside from that one mistake I still like this place. My favorite breakfast choice is the two's (see pic). This comes with 2 eggs, 2 slices of yummy bacon, and 2 slices of French toast. It's not too much food and I can actually finish this meal. 

Water will cost you extra here since afterall we are in drought mode! But they offer Voss bottled water for $1 and if you don't finish the whole bottle it's yours to keep.

For those who enjoy the music of Simon and Garfunkel, I SINCERELY recommend you going to this production at the Mayfield.  I went today and it was excellent.  The music was exceptional and the singers portraying them made you forget it wasn't Simon and Garfunkel :-)

I don't make this kind of comment often and didn't know where to post it so you all could read it.  However, if you can go to see it at the Mayfield, it is WELL worth it.  It is like having Simon and Garfunkel holding a concert all these years later for us :-)";11/09/2016 21:56

From a smooth check in, to wonderful hotel rooms, this is the best in the area. It is also centrally located in downtown and is a beautiful hotel. It is also connected to the JW Marriot and you can use the amenities of that hotel as well. This hotel is huge, and always crowded but I can easily see why. A great hotel to stay at and get a full relaxation when in Tampa!;17/01/2022 16:14

We got there as soon as it opened and was able to park across the street with no issues.

I hadn't eaten all day so I wanted to try it all lol.  So we to get different entrées and share.  We started off with the  cheesy garlic sticks ( they taste just as good as they look), I ordered the Colony, I love jalapeños on pizza and the honey was a nice touch, my sister ordered the hot chicken wedge (not pictured). We love some spice, neither were too spicy, but it was a nice added flavor.  If you're afraid of spicy you can handle both it's mild.

The restaurant is super cute, it's not a large space but it's a very nice space.  This would be a great date spot or a spot for a small group (like 4).

QrgrsxqTvYYuthlBLV2SuA;8690gLMZkjXU3xzV-DObTA;tARR9jhv5gi9TjsfSVmjmw;5;2;0;1;"I love this place so much! 

I planned a Sunday Breakfast here on a Sunday Morning - we arrived right when it opened. The owner and staff opened the doors for us and while we were waiting for the crepe grills to warm up,  a very friendly woman made us lattes.  As we were sipping on our lattes and reading the menu - a huge group of people went to the ordering counter in front of us, so the owner (I assumed out of courtesy) asked us what we wanted and started on our order. 

My companion had ordered the French Riviera Crepe and I ordered the Mediterranean Crepe, with the plan that if we were still hungry after we ate the 'hearty' crepes we would split a sweet crepe.  While I can't speak on behalf of the French Rivera Crepe (it has chicken and I'm Vegetarian) - my companion said it was delicious. The Mediterranean Crepe came with classic hummus, feta cheese, artichoke pesto, tomatoes and cucumbers - it was delicious, hearty, and filling! The contrast between the light crepe, tomatoes, and cucumber with the richness of the hummus and feta was amazing! We were too full to try a sweet crepe. Also, before I forget the plain latte was excellent - no bitter after taste, but not weak either. 

They had many vegetarian options already and the owner informed me that crepes with meat could be made without meat. Sadly, since crepes have eggs - by default not recommended for vegans. 

The cafe itself is small and simply decorated. It was also immaculately clean. The also had a small outdoor seating section if that appeals to you. The owner we meet and staff were super friendly. They had many vegetarian options. While sitting there and eating - french sounding music was playing in the background, we were eating delicious crepes - my companion turned to me and said ""this is just like the small cafes in France"" (they have been numerous of times). 

The ONLY NEGATIVE about this cafe is that there are soooooo many delicious options and a human stomach can only eat so much at one sitting ;) 

I will be coming back! I can't wait to try the Cowgirl and a sweet crepe!";04/05/2018 19:34

And when I visit a place I enjoy learning about what makes it tick. So as a tourist in the Music City I didn't feel I should ignore the opportunity to visit this museum. Especially considering the investment made in its fabulous new home in downtown Nashville. Of course, I've also toured plenty of attractions that I initially wanted to avoid only to come away pleasantly surprised. So I'm inclined give new things a try even if it isn't necessarily what I'd choose on my own. And if I don't like something, I'm usually glad I at least gave it a shot.

To start with, the entrance fee for adults is $28 USD, which is actually a little below average for an attraction of this size and quality anywhere in the world. Still, if price is a big consideration for you and you're on the fence about whether to go, you should probably bow out. I'm glad I went, but I can also admit I wasn't entirely satisfied by the experience. The facility and presentations were beautiful, and the layout and design are pleasant, but the gallery wasn't as engaging as it could have been and I was expecting a larger collection and many more artists to be featured. I especially wanted to see much more about the origins and history of country--which was pretty light relative to the attention paid to contemporary artists.

In particular, I found the tribute to The Judds a bit out of place at the entrance. And while Taylor Swift is undoubtedly an important figure in country's crossover into popular music, featuring her here just seemed to be pandering to what's currently popular. And the closing bit about the unbroken circle and the Guardians of Country Music was too contrived and self-important.

In the end, I'm glad I went. I wasn't entirely fulfilled, but I learned a few things and enjoyed the experience even if I wished for more. To me, if you like experiences, it's one worth having. But if you're easily disappointed or put off by the cost, you can safely spend your time elsewhere.";02/06/2019 16:35

q7XzjEaW-tVZf8PxDDB5sg;i1t8QVSzFW9uZr-4K_abjw;8XShad-H8bEr_p2GwFIoiQ;4;1;0;0;"Tapped is a new bar concept that has joined the slew of bars that have been building up in Maplewood. It takes over the space that was formerly housed by A Pizza Story. The theme of Tapped (thus its name) is that you pick and pour your own drinks. When you arrive at the restaurant you get an ID band. You then use this ID band to activate the different taps around the bar. They have a collection of roughly 8 wines and then 40 different beers to choose from. There are a large number of local beers, which myself and my fiancee really appreciated. 

I liked the fact that you can sample the different beers. Often times I don't want to try a full pint of some outlandish beer I have never heard off. Tapped provides the ability to try many different beers. If you find one you really like you can fill up a full pint. The wrist band limits the total amount of alcohol you can get, but unless your goal is to just get hammered this isn't an issue. 

You can also order a limited selection of pizzas and other bar food. The food fired oven installed in a Pizza Story is still there. The food has looked good, but I have yet to try it. I view the place as a bar, and the food is just an extra bonus.";07/06/2017 15:35

I've ordered from them at least twice a week for months now. The first time they messed my order up and I called, the guy was very nice and told me he would fix it the next time I ordered. Tonight, when they messed up my order and I called about it the man hung up on me twice, got rude with me on the phone, kept interrupting me and talking over me so I couldn't even explain what was wrong. The problem?.... I ordered a pizza with all sausage and half pepperoni. I got half sausage and pepperoni and half plain. Simple fix, it was only a $1.00 charge for the topping, My kids had already started eating, and I would have been happy with fixing it next time just as he had the previous time he made the EXACT SAME MISTAKE. However, as soon as he started getting rude and talking over me he lost my business forever. And this was just from a delivery order. He told me to come to the restaurant and show him my order from the GrubHub app because he didn't believe me. If I wasn't on crutches, I gladly would have gone in to get my order in the first place. However, he wouldn't even let me explain that its difficult for me to drive, hence the delivery order. The last time I was in the establishment for dine-in there were no clean tables and my son and I ended up eating on the hood of my car. I thought switching to delivery would be better than dealing with that, but its their tactics that are dirty, not just the dining room. They don't even deserve one star.;14/04/2014 01:44

I also noticed in the wine section that pricing/sale pricing can seem misleading. Wine 'on-sale' is mostly bettered by Total wine prices and many times even Whole Foods pricing.

First of all, the location is ok, but not great. It is kind of ""off the beaten path,"" in the commercial area of Harrahan, which is ok, but I am guessing only people who live in Harahan ever really go here. The parking is fairly ample.

As far as service goes, everyone seemed to be fairly professional. The lady at the register was helpful and efficient.

When you walk in, you have to order at the desk, which I actually like better than table service. They have a wide variety of teas, including awesome herbal teas. This is a big plus for me, since I don't do caffeine. 

The breakfast menu offers a wide variety of options, but since I won't be heading out that way often, I decided to jump right in and get the eggs benedict with hashbrowns. It is my firm belief that if a cafe can get that dish right,  everything else will be awesome. There is real skill involved in making even a decent benedict.

When my breakfast came out, it looked ok, but since I eat with my eyes first, I would say that it would be worth it for the business to invest in slightly nicer plates and to add some green to the dish for color. A little parsley on the potatoes, for instance, wouldn't hurt, or even a slice of orange with the peel flipped up along side the eggs. These additions would be inexpensive, and would make the dish so much more appealing. 

The flavor of the benedict itself was good: lemony and well balanced. None of the yolks were overcooked. Still, I was missing the benefits of a ""pretty"" breakfast.

As for decor, as a customer I dislike cheap/stereotypical kitchen decor, and this place is the poster child for ""I went to Kirklands and bought some chef pictures."" It would be great if the owner could, instead, find some local artists with Louisiana themed pieces, and put the art up on consignment. It will give the cafe a more personal feel, and the owner wouldn't have to spend a dime.

Also, there is a nice little cubby in the center of the room...filled with things like Styrofoam to-go boxes and random, hodgepodge decorations. Maybe those things could be swapped out for a little merchandise like cute mugs branded with the business name.

Most of all, the back wall above the large windows has an obvious mold problem, and I found this concerning. That stuff needs to be taken care of ASAP.";27/02/2018 20:26

They could have smothered the burrito a bit more to actually make it green however again I understand they are just getting up and running.  Food flavors were all easily good.

Looked at the employees together on there phones.

It should have registered that it was sourdough, but it wasn't that great. Seemed dry and tasteless too me. Had some kind of weird sauce on it I didn't care for. My daughter had the huevos cubana and they were fantastic! Lots of egg! They made amazing looking coffee and I can't wait to go back and try something else! Great atmosphere too!

Update: 10/2019, decided to wait in line for about 40 min. So glad we did! The special was a quesadilla with carnitas and it was just phenomenal! I even told the manager how good it was. Spicy pumpkin latte was different with the spice but I loved it! Even with the amount of people in line, we only waited about 10 min for our food. Awesome!";13/10/2019 22:34

Quick service, quality, and quantity of steak truly make this place a must-try. Seating is quite limited, and so patrons often opt for the take out window. Luckily we were able to get a table at the counter. They have all their classics as well as some of their own creations. I ended up trying their South Philly Cheesesteak which blended roasted peppers, spinach, and provolone with a mountain of quality cheese. So if you ever get tired of waiting for that other cheesesteak place, make your way over to Ishkibble's!;24/03/2020 14:26

The restaurant is right in the center of Ybor city and has lots of seating and a nice courtyard. The menu is varied and has the usual Americanized items such as butter chicken or chicken tiki masala, but also has a range of items that are less common including some southern Indian dishes. They also have a great selection of vegetarian options, as well as lamb and goat options. All of our dishes were fantastic. Fragrant and tasty. The rice was perfectly cooked and the selection of breads we tried were very good too. A great choice if you're looking for good Indian food in Ybor.;22/12/2021 03:52

Seafood, seafood, and more seafood. For brunch, based on reviews, this seemed to be the place to go, so we checked it out.

I shouldn't be complaining when a restaurant offers over-sized portions of food, but this was a bit overkill.

The breakfast burrito I ordered, although tasty, could have been unfolded and used as a beach towel. It was that big.

We also had the french toast. Another case of the food being tasty, but I feel like the order was a half a loaf of bread.

I'm not docking them any stars for the portions. Under any normal circumstances where I at least had a hotel microwave, it would have been great.";04/08/2020 14:21

We have been together to celebrate a baptism, a gender reveal party, and two baby showers and continue to order box lunches. Each box is VERY reasonably priced and includes an enormous amount of food, including a sandwich, side, large cookie, and usually pickle. The napkins, utensils, and condiments are individually wrapped and placed in the individual orders.  The box lunches have been the perfect way for us to stay safe and skip the buffet-style meals of the past during COVID. I have recommended this option to all of my other friends and family and recommend it to you if you will be hosting an event during these crazy times!;27/10/2020 15:12

The bread, and most ingredients were fine. The quality of meat could have been better, or fresher. The meat was edible, but had a bit of a strange aftertaste...I didn't like that. I ordered a full sandwich, which is around 13.00. The lettuce somehow tasted water-logged. If some ingredients had been fresher, I would have had a yummy sandwich! The small pickles I got were also a bit dry.
*The menu here looks amazing! I also ordered some chili-cheese fries, which were good! I imagine the chili-dogs here are good as well. I will try them again, and order something besides the Cheesesteak.";05/10/2021 02:29

First off, their pattys are decent when fresh, if you get them after they've been sitting they're going to be trash. This same thing goes for their Mac and cheese, if you go later at night the Mac and cheese will be old and tasteless. Here's the good: their curry goat and oxtails are top tier, the same goes for their rice and peas. I definitely recommend boswells if you need a Jamaican fix.;24/04/2019 05:33

The idea is cool and the atmosphere and decor is spot on.  Our server was friendly.  Unfortunately, that's where this review goes South.  I ordered a dirty martini.  The don't have Absolut, Tito's, or grey goose vodka.  The drink came out with three of the smallest olives I've ever seen dropped into the bottom of the glass.  Granted, I sent it back requesting a toothpick and was obliged.  
Oh!  They brought bread out to the table with pesto!  That tasted good.  We had stuffed mushrooms that were alright.  My salad looked like they took a handful of spring mix from Publix and put it in a plate.  I'm not kidding!  I ordered the Parmesan crusted salmon.  I would value my dinner at $8.99.  There was absolutely no pride put into this food.  In fact the salmon I had looked exactly like the frozen salmon portions I but from Walmart.  I know because we had some a few nights ago and it was strangely familiar.  The crust was not a crust.  There was a few slices of summer squash on my plate that I don't try as they were overcooked and soggy.  The mash potatoes were- ok.  This is nothing worth the money we paid.  My husband had the veal.  He said it was chewy and had a paste like coating on it.  Let me put it this way: my husband purchased a veal dinner and did not finish it.   The wait for everything from the drinks to the food to the check was not prompt or even a reasonable wait.  We actually all stood up at the table to show we were ready and needed the check.  It's really sad because it's a cool concept but going on a Friday night and being out of key dishes and not having enough staff, liquor, or food is unacceptable.  We paid, did not complain, and tipped the friendly server but won't ever go back.  It's not worth it when there places all over the place to eat.  Bummer";04/01/2020 03:23
ciiStwbMrIIDNaL_a7qZhA;l-WrCoGh4n7b6nGaTXhJNw;JXhIz744GI7U_ereD9Nf8g;1;1;1;2;"Final update: I reported Aimee to the owner. She was upset about what happened and asked for the screen shots of my conversation to discipline her, and assured me this wasn't a representation of Jack's and their beliefs. So I do. I get a text back that they can't fire her, legally, and they are sorry, they hope I return. Are you kidding me? I KNOW what happens with your food when angry employees handle it. And to knowingly walk in, just to be treated so poorly? Yeah, no. Not happening. 

If you are a Christian, you might not want to advertise it in the place. Certainly not to Aimee. She's clearly prejudiced. And I wouldn't want her anywhere near my food. Be warned.  

I've been a victim of prejudice there, even though I never stated my religious beliefs. Apparently Jack's is more than okay with it. I'm done. 

Update: Apparently, someone who works for Jacks, ""Aimee"" decided to tell me that I'm a liar. They claim that the scones are never microwaved, that they were tough, because I let them get cold. Which is a crock. Anyone that knows anything about cooking knows that once you microwave bread items, it toughens up when it reaches room temperature. I have had many scones at Jack's before. Not a single one of them have ever been tough because I've left them to cool. Usually, a fried item left to get cold, gets a little soggy. Not tough. Don't you dare try to tell me what I had and didn't have at your stupid restaurant. THE SCONES WERE TOO TOUGH TO EAT BECAUSE THEY WERE RE-WARMED IN A MICROWAVE! I should've eaten them anyway, broke a tooth and let Jack's pay the dental bill. Then maybe you would've believed me. No. According to Aimee, I'm just a ""yelper,"" and a ""different breed."" Jack's used to care. Now, with obnoxious employees like this, no wonder they're terrible. Wow. What a disrespectful way to treat those that keep your business going. 

For that reason, you lose another star.  Great way to treat customers, Jacks. 

Next update gets better: I told her she doesn't belong in customer service, acting like that, she should lose her job. And I get accused of being a ""Christian,"" and she's willing to overlook that to give me fresh scones and coffee. So now Jack's is in the business of mocking customer's beliefs? 

Their job is to make food and serve it. Regardless of religious affiliation. Aimee has been blocked and reported to Yelp.";28/05/2019 16:48

Since I'd already been outside all day we ate inside and it ended up being pretty nice and clean inside. We were immediately greeted by our server Allie. I liked her right away. Very friendly, attentive, and she had a good sense of humor. She was on top of things the entire time and I would return just to see her again. 

My son got the Chili Burger and I got the Bbq Burger. My burger had a lot of sauce on it. If that's a problem then I'd say to specifically request to go light on the sauce or just get the sauce on the side. Now both burgers came out cooked as we liked them and were very tasty.  The sidewinder fries came out perfectly cooked and were very good as well. 

I totally forgot to check in on Yelp. For those that go make sure you do. They have a $5 off $25 coupon. I will return for the great service I got from Allie and the burgers for sure.";03/09/2019 17:28

The recommended time to check out the whole place is 3-5 hours, and I can see why. There are a lot of different planes and helicopters to check out. I don't think I got to see the whole thing, because of how much there was.
They had the Air Force One that transported Kennedy and Johnson there, as well as the same type of plane used for the movie Top Gun. But they also had a bunch of old airline planes that I had never heard of or haven't seen in a while. Vietnam era helicopters and others that are currently used, too.

It can get really hot walking around the whole place, so drinking water is highly recommended for the time you are there. A must for fans of aviation and history, though.";21/10/2019 00:11

Typically, the food is great and service is good but not today. The service, more than the food, the order was wrong when it came out, which I attribute to our server not writing anything down. Once we had our meal, we were forgotten and when the server did come back to ask us if we needed anything (our glasses were empty) she did so seeing we had nearly finished the meal and it seemed she was just asking so she could bring the check. We had to ask for refills to finish our meal. Still a nice day and decent meal, just the service needs some attention.;23/09/2020 22:27

Once inside, there were so many amazing shakes, ice cream, and frozen novelties to choose from. The littles got traditional cookie dough shakes while the adults got the midnight milkshake & the strawberry cheesecake. The inside of the place is pretty small--just a few tables & they're not available to dine in right now because of COVID-19. However, we were able to wait comfortably, and it only took a few minutes for our order to be ready. The shakes were DELICIOUS. They were so creamy, fresh, and had plenty of mix-ins.

There is an ordering counter with the menu on the wall.  But, if you are dining in, there is table service and hand held menu ordering.  Service was quite good, but there were only two tables of customers at the time I was here.

While I'm not necessarily hooked by any of the dishes, there are a few items that are not common:
1. Soujek Wrap- house made sausage wrapped in a pita with garlic tahini sauce.  It was just a wrap, nothing spectacular.  The fries were actually more impressive, coated and super crispy.  
2. Fatayer-  Huge basket of ground beef pies.  The pie shell portion was tender and served hot.  Again, not bursting with flavor or anything, but a large portion for only $5.99.  My husband could not stop eating them.  But, the flavor just reminded me of a Krystal burger.

Almost $6 for a service of hummus, no thanks.  The same for the Fatoush and Falafel bricks.  There are many other places in the area, so for this price, they might want to step their game up.  

I hope that the Babaghanoush is worth a trip back.

After a few days of looking at Uber costs, I went to the front desk of my hotel and asked about alternate transportation. Sir, we have the St Charles Street car! Download the app and you'll see times, pricing, etc.. 

Now that's what I'm talking about!

I'm from New York, no need to hail an Uber when I have the oldest working trolley system in the United States still in operation! For a little over a buck I'm hitting up the most of the highlights of the city. And let's not get it twisted, I've been on the San Francisco trolley. They have to stop traffic and physically turn the damn trolley? What. The. 

New Orleans has it down, it's a pretty unique system. Every time I hopped on, it wasn't jammed like a NYC bus.

Comfortable, running on time and historical is how I'd best describe the St Charles Street trolley. 

PS- when I was on the San Francisco cable car, I was humming ""The San Francisco treat"". It would have been nice to be greeted by a band, something. Get on that the next time I visit.

I ordered a wet woody which was amazing as usual, as well as coconut prawns (delicious and succulent), and a filet mignon. The food was well-prepared and the perfect temperature. The bill on the other hand, was very high.

At the bar we were greeted by the bartender and offered the specials. Of course I'm on the hunt for Bloody Mary's so I ordered the regular one and my wife ordered Peach Bellini. She offered to the special of unlimited drinks for both of those but we declined. 
The bartender then made a few suggestions and we ordered one of the suggestions. The brunch selection is very eclectic and well thought. My wife ordered the Meat Scramble and I ordered the 3 Little Pig Sandwich. 

My wife's dish looked good but my fish was phenomenal. The sandwich was made of jalapeño cornbread biscuit with sausage, egg, bacon and a spicy sauce.  It was more in the sandwich but that's what caught my attention as I was devouring it. 

I then ordered the Smoked Bourbon Bloody Mary. The glass is smoked by burning a wood plank then placing the glass on the plank to give it the smoke effect. Although the bourbon is a bit strong for my taste it was good. The bartender suggested the next time that I can trade it for vodka. I thought that was thoughtful.

I waited there -- FREEZING -- for another half-hour before I finally just put my clothes back on, demanded my co-pay back, and left.  I never even saw the doctor, and I was there for TWO HOURS total.  What's more, I was a new patient and had a bunch of things that I wanted to talk about with the doctor, but the tech told me that Dr. Taylor will only talk about two issues at a time.  WHAT?  So after waiting that long (and of course it would have been longer had I stayed) I still would have had to come back a second time just to have all my questions answered?  This is unacceptable.

I've only been here twice and each experience has been very horrible with just this one worker.  The first time I'm going to get a slice of pizza and she pulls the whole thing out of the rack right in front me... which was fine because a fresh one was coming out... I waited nearly 30 minutes for her to take her precious time slicing the pizza while she continued to talk with the cashier... one stroke at a time......  I let that slide at the time.  This time I come back a few months later hoping there is pizza available and there weren't.  No biggie so I go to the next warmer to try one of those stuffed pocket thingies.  She literally barges her way in front my sight as I am arms length from the door and just stands there.  Then she slowly starts taking everything out.  Doesn't say anything, achknowledge or anything of the sort.  After grabbing maybe 10 items she finally start to check the ingredients on the back of the last 3 items... slooooooooowly.  I don't know what her problem is but she needs an attitude adjustment and to quit acting like I am not here trying to shop.  Don't get me wrong I like things fresh and can wait for fresh.... but I don't like a funky attitude that goes with it.;16/03/2019 20:50

I've gotten a wedding & a different wedding's rehearsal dinner to serve Sweet Lucy's BBQ... It is the holy grail of Philadelphia Barbecue. 

Whether you're gorging on their Monday night buffet (the last buffet on earth I will subject my body to) or grabbing takeout (don't forget the extra fixin's!) the food is always fan-flipping-tastic. If you're not a buffet person, it's worth going to the one at Sweet Lucy's just once, so you can try one of each of their mouthwatering options in one sitting. (Be forewarned, you may have something like a religious epiphany while there.) Some barbecue joints serve their meat without sauce, but not so at Sweet Lucy's. Theirs is a perfect blend of sweet/tangy/tart/smokey deliciousness that is on the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs, and I always get extra to put on because who wouldn't want extra happiness on their sandwich? (So if you're doing take-out, don't miss the fixin's station to the right of the cash registers. Get some of that business (and some pickles!) to go!)
 
Best Side: Sweet Potatoes
Best Meat: BBQ Pulled Pork (with shout-outs to smoked kielbasa & ribs)

However, the lack of instruction to not stand in the waiting room with the others while waiting to be seated, but to instead shove through everyone else and take any empty seat, was the first question mark. After asking and then and only then being told we could sit at a table, we waited. Another couple sat next to us and a waitress took their order first. After looking around obviously perplexed, another waitress came up and took our order. We did receive our food in a timely manner and it was fairly good. The bright side in an otherwise dark story. So then we waited for our check. At some point the waitress came by and we asked and she said ""oh I forgot your check!"". No big deal, they were busy and things happen, although we already went through a few things so far, but then she never came back. And keep in mind the place is only so big and we were no more than 5 feet away. I went to get up to the counter where she was talking and then she gave me the check, so I went to pay and took out my bank card. This is when I was told ""cash only"". No where on the entrance door, on the walls, or anywhere else that I could see during our visit was a notice of ""cash only"". Nor did the waitress think it important enough to mention during this visit to a restaurant in the 21st century. But, wait! A solution! Of course they have an ATM for you to get cash. For a fee that they get a percentage of. How thoughtful to provide this service. Why use credit cards that cost you a fee, when you can charge people a fee to give you cash! To me that is pretty crooked.

I was searching for a good Pho restaurant.  I saw the reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a try. So five of us decided to try Pho NOLA.  When we tried Pho Orchid, we were pretty disappointed. To recover our disappointment, hoping this place would be better than Pho Orchid. 
This place was packed during lunch time. we were lucky to find a table for 5. 
We were served by a server name John.  Here is what I thought of this place:
Tried many awesome Pho & I have to say Pho NOLA was far far better than Pho Orchid. 
Service from John was amazing. He was smiling whole time, make sure we get what we need & double checking by asking us if we need anything. 
Food: It was very fresh & delicious. If I have to pick few things... I had char grill pork for vermicelli dish. Little too much fat & little too chewy. Flavor can be little more marinated flavor but it was light flavor. I requested to not have noodle, just salad which was very fresh. Also Had pork spring rolls, rice paper was little too dry but I enjoyed it. 
I didn't try pho so I am not so sure how pho is like but I know I am coming back to definitely try pho. 
Oh, I also tried Thai tea with tapioca. Thai tea was little too sweet & less tea flavor for me. 
All my coworkers just loved their food & they told me to pick lunch restaurant from now on. 
At the end, my lunch was $21 including tip. Again, I am not a good tipper but I gave John more than 20% which in my book, he rocks!  (no I am not related to him what so ever. LOL)";12/05/2015 21:05

This is my favorite Little Caesars in the Tampa Bay Area. First, the staff had great customer service. Friendly with warm smiles. It was hard to say no when they asked if I wanted to upgrade to the meal (with crazy bread and a 2 liter). In a act, it was so hard that I said yes! 

This location is conveniently located on the corner of a strip mall. There is lots of parking and the inside of the store is bigger than most other Little Caesars in the area. This store is a perfect example of what Little Caesars does right.

For some time, I have had fun calling the Hot & Ready Pizzas Hot & Sweaty Pizzas. I would have probably given this location 5 stars had it not been for the fact my last pizza was a bit more sweaty than ready. It seemed a bit under cooked. Nevertheless, whenever your get the awesome deal called Hot & Ready, there is always some risk of hit of miss. 

I will keep coming back to this location for the clean and large store and great customer service. Surely there will be a few more misses (sweaty pizzas), but I hope for a greater percentage of hits (ready pizzas). And remember, even if the pizza is a bit sweaty, it will always taste better than a frozen pizza you cook in your oven, and if you have seen prices at the grocery store for frozen pizzas, many of them will cost you a lot more than just picking up a Hot & Ready at your local Little Caesars.";27/01/2013 19:13

Dozen baked all their bread and pastries in house, daily which makes for what I think, the best bread in Nashville. Combined with the mix of traditional and experimental dining options, this is one of my new favorite spots in Nashville. The menu offers breakfast and lunch on weekdays and brunch on weekends. It consists of salads, sandwiches, tartines, soups, and baked goods. You can even mix and match 1/2 a sandwich or tartine with a salad or soup. All the ingredients are extremely fresh and for the most part local as well. The portion sizes are not too big, but definitely filling. I had the egg in a hole with caprese salad which had  toasted homemade sourdough and an egg over medium. The bread was toothsome, buttery, crunchy, and not sweet unlike most american bread and the egg was perfectly over medium with a somewhat runny center. The salad was extremely fresh and not overdressed. You could tell it was made to order. My friend tried the benton sandwich which had such a beautiful combination of peaches, pesto, tomatoes, and bacon on a baguette. He was very pleased with it. We split a pastry that was like a croissant with strawberry filling and it was divine. So flaky, buttery, and moist but not too sweet and perfectly paired with the strawberry preserves. Dozen serves Crema coffee, which is some of the best in Nashville, and gives free refills. 

Though the spot is a little out of the way, it's certainly worth the trip. I went on a sunday for brunch and was pleasantly pleased to not find a line  or 45 minute wait or slew or bachelorettes in matching t-shirts. Just some young hip locals and family's enjoying a modern and cozy spot. Dozen is minimally, but expertly decorated to keep the vibe casual but still alluding to the artsy neighborhood it is located in. Even the bathrooms are decked out in cool graphics.

No, you can tell by texture, color, etc. It's over cooked...

I am changing my review from a 1 star to a 4 star. This is all due to the lighting quick response from Nate, who messaged me and rescued the situation. He provided a detailed explanation of why the issue occurred, how they were going to make sure it never happened again, and offered to help find a suitable venue for my team dinner. Even though I had already found another venue, I really appreciated his response. I will be putting 5th & Taylor back on my rotation list.

-------------------------------------


This review is not about the food, because they cancelled my reservation and I was never able to sample it, but their service. Long story short, I made a reservation on Thursday for Monday night, got a confirmation text on Sunday night and 10 minutes after receiving the text got a call from the restaurant cancelling it. Apparently, someone decided to book the whole restaurant the day I happened to have a reservation and they were kind enough to call and tell me the good news that my reservation was no more. I loved the fact that she followed it up with, "" I can help you make a reservation for another day"". I was a little upset as this was a team dinner for co-workers coming in from out of town and I had to scramble to find another suitable restaurant. When I mentioned that it was very inconvenient to be told this late that my reservation was being cancelled, the answer was less than satisfactory. In short she didn't care and offered a hollow apology and that was that. 
I understand that they are a business and if someone is offering to buy out the whole place they won't say no. But at the end this business is focused towards customer service so if you're causing a potential customer an inconvenience, try to offer solutions and if you can't then maybe an incentive to remain a customer.";07/03/2016 03:14

Our driver picked us up directly from our hotel that morning. We were with 4 other people, which was perfect. Then we were off into the gorgeous countryside of Santa Ynez! We visited 4 vineyards throughout the day, each with a unique character and wine-tasting experience. We started with a larger, more commercial winery and ended up at a lovely family-owned vineyard. Since there were only 6 of us, we were able to really engage with the owners and wine experts at all of the wineries. Our driver/guide also took care ordering lunch for the group from a place called Panino's - AMAZING sandwiches! We never felt rushed at all, our guide let us enjoy ourselves for as long as we wanted at each winery. He also drove us through the actual vineyards and provided a lot of historical background about Santa Ynez.  I honestly would not have changed a thing about our experience. The cost is $120 per person. Totally worth it for the gorgeous views, wine knowledge, lunch, transportation, and of course the copious amounts of incredible wine you will taste!

Now it could be exaggerated by the fact that I had just walked out of Kentwood Ford after telling them where they could respectfully place their pressure 'sales' techniques (and by respectfully place I may or may not mean shove it!!).

I walked in knowing exactly what I wanted and exactly what I wanted to pay for it.  And I walked out with just that - exactly what I wanted for exactly what I wanted to pay - is this real life???  They were straight forward and did everything they could to track down my dream car (which turns out was in BC).  Made sure that I got every deal available (winter tires and rims, a way more than wicked deal on my crappy trade in, and they even gave my dad a referral bonus even though he had only talked to this sales guy once before but had not purchased anything which is typically how the program works).  

By the way the referral program is actually not bad - not like 'go-auto' who gives you $500 bucks towards services they offer at their locations - $750.00 (minimum) cash to do whatever you see fit with - like an actual incentive, not ""here's $500 bucks that you can give right back to me when I perform overpriced services on your car in my shops only...blah blah blah.""

In general, I found Rob (the sales guy) and Ashley (the finance lady) to be respectful, straight forward, and fair.  I didn't get the vultures swarming feeling when I walked in which is a plus.  I do have to mention - Rob pulled the best sales technique on me I thought - after we settled on the price I said I needed a few hours to think about everything.  Rob says no problem - here take this other ford focus to drive around while you are thinking - Brilliant Rob!  Since I have huge buyers anxiety this may have been the best way to get me to come back and not just chicken out!

Never mind that, the food was very good. We split two orders of the vegetarian rolls (3 per order). Two of us ordered the Pad Thai; the other two ordered clay pot soups. One soup was Green Curry Seafood Soup in clay pot (very spicy) and served with rice. She loved it. 

I am blanking on the other soup.  It was in a clay pot and was more tomato based and not served with nice, nor was it as spicy. She also enjoyed her lunch immensely.

The Pad Thai was listed as spicy so we both requested the dish with less spice. The restaurant happily obliged. The dish did skimp on the shrimp (only 4, and tiny), but was generous with the tofu and sprouts. It had good flavor, but I picked up a strong syrupy sweetness at the end.

I stopped for lunch at 1:30 which makes one think you'd be outside the normal lunch rush/crowd. The drive thru was wrapped around the building. I've seen this often and normally they move the customers very speedily.

I sat still for over 5 minutes so I decided to pull out of the line, park, and go in to get my order to go. As I got in line I noticed the cashiers being friendly with the customers which is great but to carry on a conversation with them while others are waiting to give their orders is not so cool.

Finally I was able to place my order. The young man made some sort of mistake punching it in and had to restart. I waited 5 minutes on my original chicken sandwich combo.

Everything about this event was fun.  Just like you see on cooking shows, Beth stood in front of the 3-tiered seating area, with a camera on her, and a camera overhead showing inside the pot she was cooking in.  Beth is an experienced baker, and I loved that in addition to demonstrating how to make the Bourbon Chocolate Pecan cupcake, she also gave us helpful tips for substitutions and shortcuts.

In addition to cupcakes, the event included 3 cocktails, specially designed to compliment the cupcakes we would be taking home.  Pumpkin Prosecco - made of champagne and pureed pumpkin, Hard Apple Cider - made with gin, cider, and fresh crushed grapes, and a Bourbon Cocktail - but after the first two drinks, I have no recollection of what went into this last one.  It was great, though! :-)  Roger, the bartender from the hotel restaurant Élevage, came in each time to explain his concoction, which was really a nice personal touch.

After Beth demonstrated how to make the first cupcake, all the participants went down to group stations where we got to frost our own cupcakes.  She had all the different cupcakes lined up for us, as well as the different bags of frosting.

First we did our own Bourbon Chocolate Pecan cupcake - by scooping out the inside to fill it with pecan filling, then frosting it with a thick bourbon chocolate buttercream, and sprinkling roasted pecans on top.   Next was the Hard Apple Cider cupcakes with cinnamon buttercream.  And finally we did the Pumpkin Spice cupcake, with a sweet cream cheese frosting.  I have to admit, there was a LOT of taste-testing the frosting, even after the cupcakes were all frosted.  Beth even provided plastic cupcake containers, so our 6 masterpieces (2 of each flavor) could travel in safety and comfort.

I would definitely do another event here - it was very well organized, and in addition to the promised take home cupcakes, we were also provided with recipes on how to make the different cupcakes and frosting.

The only thing that wasn't cool, and wasn't mentioned ahead of time, is that you had to pay $5 for valet, which also meant tipping too.  I think the Epicurean Hotel needs to include this in the cost of the class, or let people self-park in the spots they have available for the wine store or bakery.

Other than the parking, an A+ event from start to finish. Support local small businesses and go check out Beth's webpage, too - yum!";12/11/2014 14:02

As I browsed over the good reviews I was shocked, as our experience was nothing like what I read. My sister-in-law and brother were moving out of Nashville, and she had a Groupon for this place that needed to be used. It was a Wednesday night, and my boyfriend and I wanted to dine with them. Having been to Anatolia's (which is awesome, by the way), we knew just where to go. Getting there was simple, but that's where the good part ends.

We arrived, and the restaurant had only two other tables being served. We waited at the host's station for at least five minutes, having the only waitress walk by us then noticing that there was a lady within plain view doing something with the cash register in the bar area. My boyfriend went to ask about seats, and we were told to sit wherever we wanted. She brought us menus a few minutes later, and about ten minutes after that the waitress asked for our drink orders. By then we knew our food order too, so we ordered all at once. About five minutes later we received our drinks (three waters and one tea). We were supposed to get salads before our meal, but after about twenty minutes of no one checking on us or bringing us salads I started get annoyed. Ten minutes after that I was pissed, but my brother and boyfriend talked me into having a sense of humor about the place. So, from then on out I laughed when things went wrong; I ended up laughing a lot.

So, we never got our dinner salads, even though a table of girls who came in 20 minutes after us did. We also never got an appetizer we ordered. We did, however, get greasy garlic bread with our meal. It seemed to be the only thing that was fresh. Our meal came after an entire hour of waiting, and our waitress spouted the most nonsensical babble I've ever heard from an adult. She laughed and made inappropriate jokes to other tables too, calling one room a ""make-out room"" for a middle-aged couple who looked completely embarrassed. 

The food was less than average, in my opinion. I had pasta with a vegetable red sauce. To be honest, the horrible experience had totally made my taste buds biased at this point; it would have been the most heavenly food in the world to impress me.

When she asked us if we wanted dessert, I literally laughed and asked for our checks in the nicest way I could. She was obviously oblivious, and after another twenty minutes of waiting on checks we simply handed her our cards as soon as we glanced at the checks. I paid for dinner, as I had been the one to suggest my boyfriend accompany me to this place. There was no way I was going to let him pay for the little less than two hours we spent in this place.

So, heed my warning - do not go to this restaurant if they reopen! Find another Italian place with consistent reviews; no matter what you're guaranteed a better experience than this place.";13/02/2011 15:23

After messing up two of my nails, she removed all the nail polish to re-do them, buffed them down, & without even wiping it off fully she put the color directly on, not even thinking to clean my nail or start again with the base coat. And I did not receive a top coat. Worst manicure I've ever received. I'll go back because the other women there are amazing but I definitely will not pay for her (lack of) service.;27/01/2017 22:30

LPmKRRiU4i82IAnc8sONtg;2fWMTXLNI8me38FTjvLrdQ;JPfe9B-RLrE5Nz75kcKImQ;1;2;1;0;"There are two schools of vegetarian: those that embrace vegetables -- from beans to greens to grains -- and the 'meat substitute' kind.  Lately, restaurants have been trending toward the former, but Govinda's is squarely in the old camp.

Perhaps faux-meet vegetarian can work, but it doesn't at Govinda's.  My ""burger lover's"" wrap contained a soy-based ""meat"" with a pungent after taste.  It was so unappetizing that neither I nor my companion could finish it.  The other dinner, a ""meat""ball sandwich, was at least palatable, but only barely so -- with generous camouflage courtesy the cheese and tomato sauce.

The French fries we shared were greasy and soggy.

(We did eat in the quick-serve area closer to the corner of Broad & South; the dining room was closed for renovations, and perhaps that menu might be different).

Can meat-substitute vegetarian restaurants work?  It has been done successfully -- the Horizons restaurant comes to mind.  But for me, this sort of place gives vegetarianism (and veganism) a bad name.  Implicit in eating here is a sort of compromise: the food tastes weird, and to the degree that it's editable, it's because it's been smothered in cheese, as in each of the items in our order.

Rather, a better (and tastier) model for vegetarianism is to embrace all vegetables, and create delicious dishes, not poor meat substitutes.  Beans, cous-cous, hummus, yellow rice, bell peppers, asparagus, green beans -- all can be ingredients in delicious dishes.  

But Govinda's takes the other approach -- vegetables are just along for the ride.  Until restaurants like this one get the message, vegetarians/vegans are doomed to the stereotypes; we're going to have to keep answering the question ""how can you eat that stuff?"" and ""if all you can eat is salads, don't you get hungry?""

So, in sum, the ingredients were reasonably fresh, but the faux meat was revolting.  Go elsewhere.";28/04/2012 13:53

I like the decor and the solid selection of beers on draft. I had a Belgian Wit beer with a slight hint of apple nose. I know it sounded weird enough to me, to want to try it and I really liked it. I forgot the name of it but it was good, not sweet, just a hint of apple on the sour/citrus side.

-Can't remember the managers name off the top of my head that I spoke with, so bear with me on the physical description, he's the skinner guy with brown hair and glasses.-

90 degree weather outside and we had a sick person who could not leave the room. Ridiculous in my opinion. 

The hotel itself left much to be desired. 

The water (shower) self adjusts temp from hotter than the devils spit to colder than my ex's heart. 

The electricity in the room seemed to be a little iffy, as the light (the ONE that turned on) kept flickering. 

The staff did seem friendly at first, later to find that it was not genuine. 

After consulting the manager, Joel, I believe is his name, at check out, we were told they would agree to refund us one night. We then were told they cannot not issue a refund in person and that we had to contact our booking site (hotels.com). After leaving the hotel we contacted hotels.com, as we were instructed, and were then told Magunson was denying the one day refund. 

It was a back and forth battle and eventually we were issued a refund, yet I'm unsure if it came from the hotel or hotels.com. You think a hotel would want their guests to leave happy?

Usually the drive-thru is ridiculously slow,  and nearly every time our orders are messed up.  A colleague ordered one of the whatever-chocolate milkshakes (dark chocolate? Chocolate fudge? Whatever.) and somehow ended up with strawberry (which she has an allergy to) and banana in it.   I ordered cajun fries and instead of the usual (read: well-mixed and deelicious), they just put regular fries in the cup and shook some cajun seasoning on the very top ones.    Another colleague paid extra for something (bacon? cheese? I can't remember), and it was left out. One asked for (I think it was) BBQ sauce at the speaker, and then again asked at the window to be sure, to which the woman snapped ""It's in there!"", and of course it wasn't.    

Last weekend I had a craving for one of the Nutella shakes. So, I ran up here on a break. It was all I ordered, they were slow, but somehow I ended up with a cup that was only 2/3 full (the top of the whipped cream didn't even reach the rim of the cup..?!?), and seemed to be plain vanilla. Since they also just put plain chocolate sauce on top, as opposed to the Nutella drizzle, I had assumed they just screwed it up and gave me some plain vanilla thing, but toward the bottom there was suddenly some weird, watered down Nutella taste with a bunch of ice crystals.

 I don't even know. I think at this point we have all given up on even bothering trying ""one more time"". The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is because it sucks, but not quiiiite as much as the Steak n Shake DooDoo Diner on Pendleton Pike.";26/05/2015 08:20

That's what you can expect if you're a traveler with a disability traveling through Indianapolis International Airport, an otherwise excellent airport that certainly ranks among the nation's better airports in terms of both amenities and service. 

It's well known that if you're in a wheelchair and are unable to go through TSA's body scanners that you will experience a full-body pat down. 

While I'll admit that I somewhat question this policy, while also acknowledging that someone in a wheelchair is perfectly capable of endangering themselves and others, the truth is that Indianapolis International Airport consistently gives the most intrusive and intimate body checks of any airport I've experienced. 

Admittedly, I'm not a frequent traveler. 

In 2014, the employees at Indianapolis International Airport were recognized by Indianapolis's Mayor's Advisory Council on Disability for their efforts at accessibility and in providing accessible transportation to individuals with disabilities. 

I don't think they lost any points for their version of ""Invasion of the Butt Scratchers.""

While every airport does a variation of the full body pat down, with one exception I've never experienced the truly intrusive ""pat downs"" that I experience at Indy International. While they offer to take you into a private area to complete the pat down, the simple truth is that even the best agent can't possibly overcome a policy that encourages violating someone dignity in the name of public safety. I mean, yeah, I realize I'm paralyzed and can't feel my rear end but that doesn't mean I'm rushing to blow it up. 

I mean, seriously. I'm pretty sure an 8-year-old could do a take down on me if I started acting out. 

Other than the overly invasive body searches for individuals with disabilities, Indianapolis International Airport is a beautifully decorated airport with an open concept, nice tech supports including charging stations, and a decent number of restaurants for what I would consider to be a medium-sized airport. The staff, even those sticking their gloved hands up your butt cheeks, are friendly and helpful. 

The security is typically fairly quick. They offer nice curbside baggage options, excellent and reasonably priced parking options, and generally have remarkably clean facilities. With only two concourses, Indianapolis International Airport is also easy to maneuver, a fact that makes me wonder why it doesn't serve as more of a connecting airport. 

I do rather despise that you have to leave the main floor to pick up baggage, a bit of a hassle, and you have to go from baggage carousel to baggage carousel to figure out which one's applicable to you. However, this is a minor problem for an otherwise top notch airport experience.";21/06/2015 01:05

That just happens from time to time and something telling me maybe I don't need all that bourbon. 

There were family members of the owners at the bar who were great and bought us all a shot of tequila.  You don't get that everyday. He even sang for us and his wife told us a great joke.  I felt really at home here. 

I had the scallops entree and they were spot on and prepared perfectly.  The spinach salad was good too. Dessert was great.

Ok - this is not a Rick Bayless restaurant but the quality of the food is always good.  You will find a pretty standard ""Americanized"" Mexican menu with lots of burritos, enchiladas, beans and rice. My favorite dishes are the carnitas and chori pollo. Again, we're not talking about James Beard award winning food but it is simple food with fresh ingredients well done.  I've been eating here for years and I have been happy with every meal.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the family that runs this restaurant is just great. They are the main reason that I keep coming back. It is just great how they constantly show appreciation to their customers.  I have no hesitation recommending this restaurant.";04/08/2013 00:02

Dear Mid-city,

I've called you home for 8 years now. I'm raising my kiddos here. But lately I've been worried about you with the influx of non-local businesses. Please stop that. We also need a hardware store since home depot closed. I vote for a locally owned Ace Hardware. We could use some more local food options on Carrollton too. Don't want us turning into a baby metairie y'know.

I'm loving that we now have Swap Meet NOLA. 'bout time we got an art market of sorts. I'm also loving what city park has going on and the Bayou Boogaloo is awesome. I'll even grudgingly throw some love to voodoo, jazz fest and endymion.

I had become accustomed to having my nails done by someone who took great care in keeping my natural nails as healthy as possible and painting my nails very nicely.  Since coming to this area I have had many bad experiences while trying to find similar service.  I have literally tried every shop along the main thoroughfare in my area and have had bad experience after bad experience.  The bad service ranges from non-sterilized tools to having a file handed to me when I politely asked to have my toenail filed straight (because it was filed crookedly).  And if that wasn't bad enough, the technician made a scene when I didn't tip her!!

During my search I came across several reviews about Twisted Sisters (many from Groupon or Yelp users) that stated ""is okay"" but ""nothing special"" to quantify the extra cost.  To counter those claims let me just say that they are WORTH EVERY PENNY  if what you are looking for is quality workmanship without the worry of getting a fungus--which is exactly what I've been looking for.  

I have had my nails done by all three ladies and they have all done a top-notch job.  I value the time spent getting my nails done because it's ""me"" time and these ladies really add to the experience.  They are all very kind and accommodating.

This place works if you are a beginner (they have a class to teach the basics) or a seasoned student of Iyengar, far along in your practice.  This is IYENGAR yoga, a Hatha yoga practice whose focus is alignment and strength.  Iyengar is perfect for everyone especially athletes looking to strengthen and enhance their most precious piece of equipment (one's body) as well as those on the opposite end of the spectrum who may be totally non-athletic but want to move their body and increase their chances for a long an healthy life - a life with increased flexibility.  
This studio is very low key and unassuming.  The teachers are well trained and have sufficient hours logged in the discipline to qualify to teach you.  I have my favorite teachers but I suggest you take a class from all of them to see who appeals to you.  Iyengar teachers tend to be a bit stern and demand that you LISTEN and are present in your practice.  This can be daunting to some new students but ultimately this is personal preference and you just need to find the Practice yoga teacher that suits you best.
This is NOT a ""power yoga"" studio and while you may sweat you will not be racing through asanas  you're not sure you're doing correctly and getting your heart rate over 150 bpm. While I appreciate that some folks dig this ""style"" of yoga this is not what is practiced here.

The server was super-friendly, and gave me a nice healthy pour of wine right in front of me.  Magically, a man brought over a little platter with two dishes of snacky stuff - some nutty crunchy mix and cheesestick crackers, which I dug right into (even though I had just eaten a full dinner).  

Interestingly, there is a glass of $650 cognac offered for on the menu (which is limited at that time of day to drinks and bar food).  When we asked about it (like, in a way that said who the hell would ever order this $650 item) the waitress brought the bottle over so we could check it out and let me smell the stuff.

I've been coming here since I was a tiny little girl and have now raised my kids coming to Sneddons for a special breakfast that always took me back to my childhood. But now I dont want to come back. And by the looks of the sparsely populated tables, neither do many of other locals who have frequented your business since we were kids.

Why? Sky-high prices and stingy servings.  Took the two kids there last Friday because they were begging for the cottage fries, a Sneddons favorite.  One son got a club sandwich with the cottage fries, the other eggs and pork roll with cottage fries. I got the BLT. I received a BLT- that's it. Tiny plate with two small slices of toasted bread and BLT in the middle.  Not a chip or french fry in sight - $6.99.  Two of us got water and one got a soda. 

The bill for the three of us: $32.50 BEFORE tip!!! And I had to go to the register for the privilege of paying for a meal I could have made at home for $4.32. Dont forget they dont take credit cards, so be sure to go to the ATM before you get there. Even worse, the famed cottage fries were burned and looked like they had heated some old ones back up rather than make them fresh for us.

I have been noticing the price of meals out since that shocking breakfast and have noted that I could eat almost anywhere else and gotten a better dining experience at a lower price.

There used to be 4 or 5 waitresses at Sneddons that are like old friends - they knew the whole family by name. But now there are only 2, though still friendly. It used to be a wait to get a table and now we walked right in with only 4 or 5 tables occupied at 9:30 in the morning. I dont think I am the only one noticing that something has changed at Sneddons.

Friend suggested brunch at Honeysuckle for New Year's Day.
It wasn't crowded.
It wasn't loud.
The music was outstanding.
Atmosphere is nice, soothing, comfortable, muted elegant.

Sat at the bar and ordered top shelf bourbon. 
Waited on my friend.
Watched the weather turn miserable, but inside, Ole Blue Eyes was serenading the diners.
Staff was friendly, place was clean, I enjoyed the ambience.
Friend arrived and we got a booth.  Waitress brought glasses of water and menu's.
No wait. In fact, I would have preferred her hold off a tad, so my friend and I could get reacquainted and catch up with one another.. You know.. chat.

I ordered a dish off the menu, but asked if they could reinvent it for my liking.
Not a problem, I was told.
Friend ordered the duck and Brussels sprouts.  We had drinks, no bread came to the table.
No rolls. No wasted food.  Perfect for us.
Our meals came in a timely manner, cooked to our specs, portions were good sized, flavors were spot on.  We had no complaints. Only accolades.  I would have loved a few more fries cooked in duck fat.. Those were outstanding, as was my sandwich and my friends dish.

After I got home, I got in touch with another friend and asked her to come along on another food adventure at The Honeysuckle.  I'm definitely returning and look forward to trying other dishes on the menu.";02/01/2017 06:05

A few weeks ago I placed a mobile order consisting of a few cold items from the case and a warm sandwich. The whole point of placing a mobile order is that so you can just run in and grab it quickly. The only thing that they placed on the pick up counter for me was my sandwich(which was hard like they used one this someone didn't pick up instead of making a new one because I was there only a few minutes after placing the order) and my drink. I asked the shift supervisor where the rest of my order was and she said yeah it's in the case just grab it.i have never had a Starbucks make me collect all of my mobile items. Then when I asked for a bag she acted like it was the end of the world. Then today I went to pick up my mobile order through the drive thru because I had a little extra time and when I got to the window they didn't even know what my drink order was.. but they had my food? So? After telling them what my drink was they made it incorrectly not once but TWICE and the girl must have thought I drove away the first time she handed me the drink because she came back tot he window and said sorry for the wait the person in front of you was complaining about everything.

Try the tour, try the confit, and try the rich desserts.  We tried them all and have hardly a complaint.  If there is any chocolate jalapeno ice-cream hidden in the back, ask (beg), it's worth the risk.

I went there with my wife and with 5 (yes five) kids aged 12-15 after they won their championship drumline competition.

When you walk in the door, you are met with a very modern, sleek and chic interior.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who said she would be able to accomodate the 7 of us without a problem.  Once seated we decided to split the party up with my wife and I at one table and the kids at another.

I will say that most places would be irritated to have a table full of kids but the waitress was fine and took their order and was very pleasant.  She also took ours - both tables started with the Chocolate fondue.

We did try the pomegranate martini - it tasted good (sweet) and (like acai) but was light on the spirits used.   

When the fondue arrived its comes with the melted chocolate as well as an assortment of brownie squares, poundcake, strawberry and banana slices.   While the wife and I ordered the fondue for 2, the kids ordered the one for 3 which was a few dollars more but looked about the same size.   Whatever - we all enjoyed the fondue (it didn't taste like cheap chocolate) and had a good time.

Next up we decided we were hungry since we hadn't had any lunch and asked for their blue cheese chips.  The description sounded amazing, homemade lightly fried chips with blue cheese on top (we love blue cheese).

This where things went downhill as far as quality of this dish.  When the chips came out they weren't quite what we expected.   First off there wasn't any blue cheese to see, after asking about that they told us they were 'tossed' in blue cheese. Um.. OK.  Secondly the chips were all limp and greasy - as far as I can tell the vessel they gave it to us in (a bowl) wasn't fit for the job.  Secondly the chips weren't cooked all the way through and third, as far as I can tell the coagulated cheese on top appeared to have been microwaved.

We mentioned this to our hostess who took care of it and removed it from the bill and apologized and asked if we wanted anything else.

I'm giving 4 stars because the desserts and drinks were very good as well as the service - especially taking care of our complaint without questioning or accusations.   I'm sure we'll come here again and try some other foods.  It is nice to have something at the summit other than bar and italian food.";30/03/2012 13:46

A few minutes later... ""Oh, sorry, it will be another 45 min because he is coming from Lake Wales after he makes his next drop.""  No, no, no. Lake Wales is a minimum hour drive from my home so he'd be lucky to make it even in 60 min, let alone 45 min.

   Once inside, it was very cramped, and very smokey, as the bar is immediately located inside the door.   Despite this, I was impressed with the menu, it had several of my favorite dishes on it, As I love high quality executions of comfort foods, like steaks and chicken.

   I ordered french onion soup and the Chicken Parmigiana with Imported Linguini.   A simple dish, but one that I typically really enjoy. 
 
 The French onion soup was ok, but was very dark in color, almost black, including the onions.   It definitely tasted as though the main ingredient was worcestershire sauce.   Not terrible, but a little over-powering. 

  The chicken parm, however, was the worst I've ever had.   The chicken was very grainy, almost like a flounder texture, but it wasn't fishy tasting.   The imported linguine was so saturated with water, that the sauce didn't even stick to it.   It was mushy and tasteless.   The garlic bread tasted soapy.   

  I won't detail the men's room, but it rivals that of some dive bars I've visited in the alleys of Philly.

The first time I came here, I was not very impressed. The beer was on the poor side and the food was passable to good. However, I came back. And I come back because both of those aspects have gotten consistently better as I've continued to come back.
Black Swan deliberately changes their recipes to improve their beer, as well as add new beers to the tap list. They have a few standards, but others appear often and rotate frequently. And there a good number of beers on tap as well: usually about ten. And there's always a cider on tap, with occasional guest taps. Casks also appear sometimes, but I've only actually had one once, because they run out so quickly.
What I love about the food is that they make a concerted effort to use both local ingredients and keep everything fresh and healthy. Last time I was in, I had a salad with grilled chicken and cilantro lime dressing. Probably one of the best salads I've had in the state. The dressing just blew me away: you don't get that sort of bold flavor in the Midwest very often.
The best day/night to come is on Tuesday, when they do their $2.50 pint special. The crowd is typically friendly, mostly 30's and 40's, and mostly local to Plainfield or Avon. The bar area is relatively small, with only about ten seats. There are a couple of tables as well, but there's a large dining area behind the bar and a small patio on the other side of the brewing room. Service tends to good (at least in my experience), but they do get busy on certain nights. Especially Tuesdays.
For what you're getting - for both food and beer - the prices are very reasonable. You can get out for under $10 per person while eating something fresh, of good quality and likely locally-sourced. This place is certainly one of the better options along I-70 west of Indy, and really worth the slight detour if you're at the airport.";15/08/2012 05:29

Food- I had the house burger with cheddar cheese. I think based on my level of hunger, this burger tasted like the best burger that I have ever eaten.

I had garlic fries as my side and they were also great. I washed it down with one of the house beers. It was a perfect combo.

Service- Eh. Our server was nice, but she wasn't very attentive. I had to ask twice for water. I think she forgot the second time, because it took her nearly fifteen minutes to bring it. When we arrived the place was packed with football fans, but it cleared out within twenty minutes. The hostess also originally sat us at a table partially blocking the main walkway and a server had to arrange to have us moved. A bit chaotic.

Atmosphere- Great for sports fans. Loads of TV's all over the place, which is very distracting if you are not there to watch the game! Once the fans cleared out, they played some obnoxious music. Still though, it was appropriate for the type of place that it is..expect loud and busy.

I rented my car from the Hertz at the airport, location #144013 (see complaint below about this location) but I got a flat tire in the parking structure of this location as I was leaving a trade show at the convention center and leaving  for the airport. 

As I rolled in front of the Hertz location, I asked if I could leave my rental at this location because of the flat tire. I offered to pay the change of drop off location fee, but the gentleman said no.  He told us to call customer service. This was all behind a closed door and the door was locked 12 minutes before closing. Yet at that very moment, the gentleman let another customer in to rent a car. 

My jaw dropped. 

I then went to my car to change the flat tire but I knew this was going to take a while so I went back to the  front door and asked if they could assist us with changing my tire as I had to catch my plane. Please note, I gave myself 2 1/2 hours to get to the airport that was half hour away, I was now done to 2 hours.** As I tapped on the window and saw three Hertz employees, they all ignored us. I knocked again and they proceeded to ignore us. 

Lucky a good Samaritan offered to change the tire. Unfortunately, the car that was rented to us by the airport did not have the complete jack set so I could not lift my car AND the wheel nut remover was NO WHERE to be found. I went back to the Hertz office and asked if they had any spare parts, they said, ""We are closed. Call the service number."" 

Jaw drop #2. 

I proceeded to call the 1-800, which of course had a long wait (19 minutes) but the woman on the phone- who thank goodness was a saint- offered some assistance. 1hr 30 minutes until flight departure. She said to leave the car at the location and a tow truck will be over to help. She asked if I could hand the phone to the attendant at the Hertz to see if I could leave the keys with them. 

WITH the rep on the phone and on speaker, I proceed back to the Hertz door and the gentleman, after 3 knocks and stating I had a Hertz rep on the phone, came to open the door. I explained to him that the representative asked us to leave the keys with him, she seconded my response. He said, ""No, you have to wait until the towing company comes."" 

Jaw drop #3. 

I asked the woman, ""Did you hear that?"" She says, ""Yes, I am so sorry for your experience just leave the keys under the car..."" And the conversation ends. 

Despite the fact that this location did not rent the car to us, they were NO help and it was extremely disappointing and frustrating as you are trying to catch a plane. I made it to the airport as my flight was boarding Group 4. I was Group 5. 

The Hertz airport location should never have rented this car to begin with. The car told me that the RR (right rear) tire was low and it was actually the FD (front driver) tire was low, AND the darn car did not have the necessary tools to change a flat. 

There were FOUR wondering people in this story: 
1. The police officer who helped get me help with the change of my tire.
2. The Samaritan who offered to change my tower AND found a jack and nut remover to help (by the way the 4 option nut remover did NOT fit ANY of the nuts)
3. The young man helping direct traffic and flagged us a taxi
And last but not least the woman on the phone from Hertz who unfortunately has to work with a team like the 990 Convention Center Blvd location.";14/11/2013 17:56

We were told it would be a 40-45 minute wait for 3 people, so we headed to the bar to see if we could wait in there. It was very packed. The bartenders were not very friendly and were more interested in catching the basketball game on the TV. A waitress finally helped us with our drink order and we were  eventually brought 2 drinks instead of the 3 that we ordered. We knew that because it was Cinco de Mayo it would be busy. So, we didn't make an issue of it.

We were seated after about 23-30 minutes. It was a little shorter than expected, so that was good. We were given fresh hot chips with two dips; a salsa and a creamy cilantro and avocado one. Both were loaded with garlic, but fine. We ordered the grilled tilapia tacos, smoked duck tacos and the grilled tuna steak for our entrees. All three were basically good. The tuna steak came with these awesome poblano and corn grits.

Overall, the meal was pretty good. I would come back again. ...Especially for those corn grits.. They were off the hook!";07/05/2013 19:59

Any who, I came here with family and friends, and we all decided to try different platters (so we can all sample each other plate of foods). The BBQ consist of a Memphis dry rub, and three sauce you can drench it with - go for the spice! go for the spice! The briskets - moist (fatty) - in my opinion - was the best bbq at this place... it just melted in my mouth, the baby back ribs were decent (not over the top - might have been bland a bit), and the pull pork was pretty good. The only problem I really have at this place was the sides. The sides wasn't ""wham!"" in my face; the mac and cheese was okay and the cole slaw was a little running. However, the German potato salad was pretty good. 

Anyway, I really enjoy this place.

I came in wanting to bleach my jet black hair down and dye it an extremely light purple silver. It took four rounds of bleach, and over five hours, but she was super patient and took the time to get it right. You could tell she is a painter from the way she mixed the color, taking the time to go through a ton of very specific options with me before whipping up the exact color I wanted. Even after five hours of work, when she took the last round of dye out she made sure to treat my hair to counteract the damage from the bleach. Despite the huge amount of work she put in, she ended up charging me less than a third of the cost I'd been quoted at other salons. Great results AND great value.;07/08/2017 23:31

OK, so after almost a year of boycotting the place due to a sudden huge price spike, it's tentatively back in the Reno weekday rotation. Don't get me wrong, I still think the $10 resort fee is bullshit, but the prices have otherwise cooled off since down to $41-45 on uneventful weeknights after tax and fee. Our little Reno is growing up and getting all Tech Gentrified, and the hotel prices have elevated across the board a little bit such that that price is now on the competitive side again. Espc. if you get upgraded to the West Tower at a ""value room"" price, which seems to happen most of the time if they have a bunch available and you either have some status in the player's club or you flash a Total Rewards Visa at check-in. For the East Tower with its sound-leaky walls and $1.50 Keurig coffee its a bit more questionable value, but I'd take it over Circus Circus at least. Plus you can pop straight downstairs and across the street to Pho 777, which actually is a selling point for me.

To be fair the $10 increase wasn't a 100% complete cash grab. It does get you fitness center access and WiFi (where you had to pay for those separately before), and at some point in the past year they upgraded the TV selection to about 60 channels too. 

Slightly better value for Total Rewards Visa wielders as even at the lowest rate you get $2 back in comps per night thanks to the 5x rewards for spending on anything at Caesars properties. Plus the points for the base price count toward your tier points for the year.";06/11/2015 02:08

Service:

Finally some bread came but you were only given two slices of french bread. We were a little hungry so had to flag another waiter to ask for more bread....which never came.

It used to be the Collingswood theater, so it still has all the original architecture and stage as well. It's beautiful. The space can also be rented out for parties and events. Pretty neat.

Once before when they had the long communal tables and the more extensive, small plates style (which, can we all agree to kill that overstayed trend?) menu and again last night without the longer tables and newer menu. The service was excellent, atmosphere spacious but the details made it feel cozy. Only minor suggestion would be to add something (and to be honest I don't know what it would be) to soften up the space. All hard concrete floors and dark painted wood can make it feel a bit unforgiving. The mismatched colorful painted wood chairs help but it needs something a bit more. Again, very minor. We had a bottle of wine, the ploughman's platter, we shared a tomato bisque, which was excellent creamy and still had a fresh tomato flavor, my boyfriend had the braised beef. My only complaint is the chicken and biscuits on the menu. I ordered it on the favorable reviews online for the biscuit. But I had no idea it was THE MAIN feature of the dish. For $16, I was hoping for I don't know, CHICKEN with the two delicious biscuits? Instead, I got two biscuits and a chicken gravy with mushrooms and maybe a quarter of thigh meat. Sorely misleading and I won't order it again. If there was a tenderloin, or breast, or shredded chicken even, this meal would have been perfect. But man, that dish was a huge letdown. I made sure to order dessert to wash the unfortunate experience out of my mind and was rewarded with the ultra moist multi-layered vanilla bean cake with an added scoop of brown sugar ice cream. I'll definitely keep coming back but they need to fix that 'Chicken' and Biscuit dish.;17/01/2014 15:38

We started off with an order of the boneless wings appetizer, which was good, although the chicken seemed a bit chewy compared to the same order on our first visit. 

We next ordered dinner and all  three of us ordered burgers, all of them were very good, I have no complaints about the burgers.  The disappointing part of the meal is with the french fries, all of the fries were soggy and way too greasy.   Now it may seem like a trivial matter, but how can a higher end restaurant screw up an order of fries?  Again,  the meal was much better on our first visit, the fries were crispy and tasty, not soaked in grease. 

The other disappointing part of the night is solely the responsibility of the wait staff.  When a waitress brought out the appetizer, she very nearly threw the plate down on the table and almost spilled two drinks and walked away without saying anything or even asking who was getting the appetizer.  A bad night for her maybe?  We also had very so-so service from our main waiter.  At various times throughout the meal we ran out of drinks, didn't get extra napkins and at the end of the dinner, he brought us the wrong bill. 

It was such a complete turnaround from the first visit which was five star in every way possible, but not last night.  Maybe a post holiday hangover from the wait staff to the cooks?  Possible, I think we might give them another visit in the future and see.  

A few things still remain top shelf from the very good beer menu (would like to see more local brews such as Sun King, Triton, Fountain Square brewery etc.) to the one way mirrors in front of the urinals and all of the Colts themed items and autographs in the restaurant.";02/01/2013 17:57

tX8TMPDyllPQ-eAOxkdP_w;uUrpYFU-D-U76NRv5aVDdw;iC8FqRlWXqdV35kFX6Hlig;3;4;3;2;"Brazilians deserve their own reviews, because it's a very personal treatment that is not specific to the spa or salon, but to the aesthetician that performs them. And frankly, one recommendation is not enough. Too many ladies settle for their first or second experience, and I want it as comfortable and clean as I can find. That being said, this review is for the spa - specifically the Brazilian side of my experience here.

First off, Pagave is a great salon up on 202 in a quaint shopping center off of the interstage. Easy location - easy to find. I got to my appointment early, so I had time to browse the cute jewelry selection they have in the waiting area. I ended up purchasing a pair of gold earrings for New Years. 
The waiting area is SO comfortable. Comfy couches, up-to-date magazines, plenty of retail items to browse. The front desk service was mediocre, honestly. It took them a minute to acknowledge me, and I was trying to be friendly and didn't get any personality back. At the end of my service, I had to put my tip in a box and couldn't even find my aestheticians box at first. It was weird. Whatever... That's the only reason there isn't a fifth star, but based on other reviews, it doesn't seem like they care about that part. On to the important stuff: The service itself. 

I'm downright picky about how who I recommend for Brazilian waxing. It seems I've made a habit of trying out places just so I can compare techniques to others. I was out of town and without contact info for my last local aesthetician, so I poked around difference websites before deciding on Erin at Pagave for my next Brazilian. 

I was first impressed that there was no Enya music. Forget that shiz-nit. I was so glad to hear some rock music playing softly in the background. While I probably would've preferred she leave the room while I changed, she was very chill and professional, so it wasn't a big deal. After all, she would be giving me the most intimate treatment available (at a licensed, reputable salon).

With Erin, it's fast and clean. I read that she is a speed-waxer that could provide a 10-minute Brazilian, which I was originally skeptic about in terms of pain and thoroughness. And while it might not have been exactly ten-minutes, it was darn-well fast and way less-painful than any other Brazilian I have ever gotten. She talked me through exactly what I wanted and in no time, I was out the door. I was sore for the rest of the evening, which really brought me down. I've never been this sore before! She's a good conversationalist, though. We chatted about this and that; she is a pretty cool girl. Definitely one of the best that I have experienced.

The coffee is really great and affordable, but I wish they had soy milk besides almond milk to serve as a non-dairy alternative. The desserts are good, but only when fresh. Half the time I have been there, my cinnamon roll or muffin is hard like it had been left outside for two days. 

As for the evening snacks/food, most of the time after you have ordered something, they come back and tell you they are out of ingredients for the item. Which is awful, they should know when people are ordering if they are out of half the items they claim to sell. 

This place gets really loud at night with all the concrete walls and floors, so I usually bail when the tables start filling up. It's a shame, because the place is so cute at night.

This place is right beside the City Centre theatre, so a friend and I popped in there after catching a film. At the front entrance there was a sign indicating ""please wait to be seated"" so initially we did just that. There was just one family waiting in front of us. The place was clearly pretty dead; at least half of the tables were empty.

We waited several minutes without any sign of any staff members, and several people just walked past us and right in to the pub. Eventually I said ""the hell with this"" and my friend and I walked in and sat at one of several open tables. We were legitimately confused about whether we were supposed to wait or just walk in given the lack of responsiveness of staff and the behaviour of other customers.

A moment later, a man who appeared to be a manager walked over to our table with the family that had been waiting at the front in front of us, and told us that those people were in front of us and he was giving them that table. This was totally understandable and we moved without complaint and sat at a different open table.

A server came up to us and, to her credit, she was friendly and tried to be helpful. She asked if we'd been helped, we briefly summarized the situation, and she said she'd be happy to settle us in. The manager then walked over, told her not to help us, inexplicably claimed there was a wait list in spite of the fact that the place was very obviously not busy, and ordered us to go wait at the back of the line at the front (behind people who arrived after us, since the only people who arrived before us and had the patience to wait had already been seated) with a passive-aggressive ""if you don't mind"" thrown in. I replied ""actually, I do mind, since we waited several minutes there without service, several people walked straight past us and seated themselves, and clearly half the tables around us are available."" I explicitly told him we were willing to sit at any table that was convenient, that multiple people had just walked in and singling us out was totally arbitrary, and that the server had already offered to help us and resolve the situation immediately so I failed to see the problem.

His response, in a wannabe tough guy tone, was that there were plenty of other pubs in the area and that I was welcome to go to them instead. I said that we certainly would, and we left.

Kudos to the server; I feel bad that she has to work for a guy that clearly revels in creating and escalating conflict with would be customers. The only good thing I can say about the manager is that his suggestion that we go somewhere that provided better service than he did was very sensible!";21/12/2015 03:14

Today I had something happen which was a first! When I first asked a couple of questions, I perceived the waitress was a bit short to me lacking the usual good natured ness of the place.  I said nothing.  I ordered my salad with the dressing on the side as the tend to over do the potato toppings and salad dressings.  When thee waitress delivered the salad it was covered with dressing and I told the waitress I had ordered it on the Sid.  She bluntly told me, ""no you didn't!"" And I told he yes I did!!  She stated in a very sarcastic, curt manner that ""I guess I'm not hearing anything!"" Os something to that effect.
I am the most accepting person but her tone and repeated rudeness was enough and I decided to ask for the manager. I went to the bar and asked the lady working there to see the manager.  She said she would get him and I returned to my table.  My waitress came with a phone number written on a napkin and said the manager was not in but here was the number.  My friend decided to call and it ended up the number was foe a taxi company.  When confronted, the two said it was an accident they gave us the wrong number!

My waitress came to speak to me as did one other waitress to explain that we must have misunderstood the situation!!  I must say emphatically I misunderstood nothing!   
My point is to say, don't ever accept rudeness! I don't know what the problem was but it was not my problem the lady was evidently having a bad day and the manager was nowhere around.

As to the food, it was the best steak I've had there in a very long time!  It was moist and cooked the way I wanted it where in the past it was frequently excessively raw or cooked to the dryness and texture of old cardboard!  In all the years I've visited the restaurant, usually because friends wanted to go there,  within the past year I've noticed the staff getting less customer friendly and the food quality going down!  

I hope other visitors will review their experiences, and I hope my experience was an isolated one.  My visit was on May 28, 2013 at about 5PM.  The rating is for the overall experience.";29/05/2013 01:17

I went to the UYE cupcake/December/Jan birthday extravaganza right before Christmas. They had a really tasty Francoise Lambic that I wish I could have gotten more, except the cask ran out. Grr. The other beers were also very good, albeit expensive. The nachos I got were pretty dang tasty, with tons of chorizo and toppings on it. I think just about everyone who shared the order with me loved them. The burger I had was kinda a hockey puck though and it had a slightly off taste to it.

Casey our bartender was hilarious, entertaining, and quick with the tap. After he sang, I realized that he is infact the long lost 3rd member of Tenacious D. Seriously. 

The jukebox provided good tunes. The people I was with provided good times. It was nice to see old friends and meet new ones, including the truly lovely Valissa.

They offer Colombian and Cuban cuisine. It may well be the ""best Colombian and Cuban food you will find in Philadelphia,"" but that doesn't mean it is good.

The beef dishes were tough and tasteless. The fish was overcooked and dry. The Churrasco...PLEASE! And worst of all, the pork had no flavor at all! 

In Miami this place would be a definite pass it by. Although the desserts were fairly good across the board. Try nearby El Balconcito, or Sazon on Spring Garden, for latin food done better. But I'm still in search of good Cuban in Philly. Forward any suggestions.

Upon arrival, the place was packed. Not just packed as in 'full house' but packed as in 'if you were to push in one more person, the place would burst at the seems'. Tables are so close to each other that you are almost sitting on top of each other. Waiters kept knocking down my jacket trying to squeeze through and you could easily grab a bite from your neighbor's plate while you were waiting.

Food-wise there were no highlights. The free bread was cold, straight out of the fridge. This takes away from the authenticity and makes it feel cheap. Putting it in an oven for 2 minutes would not kill you and creates a fresher (literally) start to an evening. I had the penne with ""smoked"" salmon which was actually cooked salmon and my husband had the rosemary salmon. Presentation was less impressive than if I would have made it myself at home and same goes for taste. Portions were European, so smaller than Americans are used to. The tiramisu was OK although again a very small portion and presentation/taste were not making any lasting impressions.

Service-wise we definitely did not feel special. Rather, we felt like we were on a time clock. They couldn't wait to sweep you out so they could get the next person in. ""Done with your food? Here's the bill."" No special attention or smalltalk whatsoever. Also, it did not feel like an Italian restaurant. It just felt like a cafeteria serving Italian-like meals.
 
To conclude, the pricing (although not that high) does not equate the food and service quality you receive and I would definitely not recommend this place if you are looking to have a more private or romantic dinner. Honestly feel bad I wasted my time here.";04/12/2016 03:29

A salad cost more than a burger and fries. The sale was small and had 3 pieces of shrimp in it. So I paid $14 for a bag of lettuce.

I pushed it for about 10 minutes at a time and then cut it off because I got sick of waiting. I finally got service when they were bringing the check. It made it worse because the attendant acted like I'm not supposed to ask for this and it's a hassle for them to get a refill. It's your job, do it.

From beginning to end the service could not have been any worse. When we walked into the door the hostess did not seem to want to be bothered with any of the customers. I had asked for a table to seat 13 people and was told the wait would be about an hour. After about 35 minutes of waiting, my party and I noticed that the hostess had walked out of the restaurant. A customer had asked us if we were waiting to be seated and we replied ""yes,"" he then informed us that the restaurant had been struggling that night and that he waited over 30 minutes for a to go order. We were then seated after about an hour and a half wait, but when we arrived at our table there were only 11 seats and even those were crammed together. We asked management if we could have another table added to the two that were already pushed together and the staff made it seem as though it was too difficult of a task to be done, so we began to move the tables ourselves until finally one of the employees saw and politely moved them for us. The hostess we had, who never mentioned her name throughout the entire meal, had the worst customer service I have ever seen. She asked if we would like drinks but only took drink orders for 5 of the guests. When asked about one of the drinks on the menu, the waitress seemed clueless. After we finished our appetizers, our meals began to come out, but our waitress did not take any of our finished dishes from the table in order to make room. After our meals, our waitress did not even ask if we would like to have any left overs wrapped to go or if we would like dessert, even after two guests ordered cheesecake. Throughout the entire dinner, my party, as well as myself, did not have a good time and we all agreed that we will not be attending this location ever again.";18/10/2015 01:33

Of course, this is more space than I needed but I loved the room none-the-less.  Thanks for the upgrade!  The bathroom had plenty of towels and toiletries.

I have not had any problems with cleanliness nor noise at this location.  This is my 4th stay here.

I did visit the Concierge lounge on the 10th floor.  It was well stocked for both afternoon snack and breakfast.  The ladies who assist in the lounge are most helpful.

The restaurant is situated in a nice area right on the Brandywine river. The dining area is clean and elegant. However, as with many restaurants with nice views, you pay a premium for it. 

The last time I went here was on mother's day. Much to everyone's disappointment, no breakfast items were available on the menu - no eggs benedict, omelets, no nothing. I got the steak and fries. The steak ($26) was awful - it tasted like a burned shoe. Everyone except for my grandfather expressed disappointment (mild to severe) with their meal. I believe this restaurant is popular amongst the elderly as atmosphere becomes more important than food quality when your taste buds are not what they used to be.

True, classic hole-in-the-wall dive. Whatever they made, I had to have me some. So much that it detoured us from our mission to Li'l Dizzy's around the corner. Alas, not open at 1:30 in the afternoon. That gave me time to Yelp it and learn that the day you really want to eat here is Thursday when they make the seafood baked potatoes.

Everybody else wanted Italian on Thursday, so I decided to get a couple of those potatoes to go for later. 6:00 I go in there and the joint is hoppin'!  R&B music we could hear 2 doors down, folks spilling out onto the corner to smoke and drink. It's a true, blessed hole in the wall-concrete floor, dark walls, ceiling painted black except for the pieces of particle board stuck up there for some reason. You order your food at the window in the back and have a seat while a server bags up orders, hunts you down and collects your money; I don't know how she kept everybody straight, but she did.

A potato with seafood and crab meat is $12 with tax, and one would make a light meal or big side for two people. The potatoes are cooked just right, covered with shrimp and crabmeat in an étouffée-like sauce with a delayed afterburn that's not overwhelming. I loved it! They also have fried fish and chicken, and some other items I didn't pay attention to because I only had eyes for the potatoes.";11/06/2016 21:08

Their beer selection is as well.  I think the best value for the taste beer-wise is the Black Butte Porter, 22 oz of excellence for $9.

Their tapas have a huge variety of flavors.  Every time we've gone, we pick 3 and then I pick the 3 I'm going to order the next time.  Our all time favorites are their poppers stuffed with goat cheese served with a wonderful green devil sauce that we end up dipping everything into and the stuffed eggplant which has a spicy tomato sauce that is not kidding around.  

There've been a couple that we felt missed the mark on flavor (the Tostones and a potato dish that I can't recall the name of), so I'm keeping the rating at 4 instead of 5.  But on the whole I am excited to continue exploring their menu and already have my next orders picked out!

Their desserts are excellent as well.  The first time we went, we got the Banana Rum Cheesecake and it was delightful.  Last night we put in an order for the Havana Bread, which they have a 20 minute wait warning on the menu.  We had plenty of drink left so that was no big deal.  When it arrived, the aroma was amazing.  I highly highly highly recommend the Havana Bread.  Your taste buds will thank me.  As amazing as it smelled, the taste was downright sexual.

Have to also put a shout out to the very friendly and helpful staff.  The bartenders will chat away with you if they are not too busy.  It's fun to sit at the bar and watch them create the cocktails.  Also a very fun and artistic decor, great place for a date.";28/04/2012 16:00

The guys behind the glass cooks the steaks right in your face so you know it's fresh and hot. I went for the classic, Cheesesteak wiz wit, which includes the steak, cheese wiz, and onions. 

The sandwich by itself was a bit bland for me but good amount of steak and tasty onions. I had to put some mayo and ketchup (don't judge me!) to bring up the flavor a bit.

WB8J29tbpHK8xYp7dj0N8g;niyWxHK9V1JQjGEhmNr2jg;JGueVoNa1JFywVdeHtcHug;1;1;2;0;"To be fair we booked this room because it is located inside the French quarters. Right off canal street.

Pros: location, Staff was friendly, valet quick with about 15 minute advance call, AC works, bar and restaurant downstairs, artistic feel with Art Gallerie next to lobby. All these pros do not out weigh the cons this hotel has to offer at $161 a night. $45 a day for vallet.

Cons for location:
Due to location you will hear every conversation on the sidewalks, cars with loud mufflers racing down the street, the garbage man, the delivery guy, the loud music from cars, the garage filled with cars with owners hitting the horn to locate their cars all night, cars and motorcycles with loud music and loud mufflers doing burnouts all night, 

Cons for the hotel public access:
Floors were sticky through out our stay, elevator floor was sticky, elevator was not clean, carpet on all the hallways were not leveled and prupose a trip hazard to everyone, carpet in hallway poorly installed as the entire building is not leveled.

Cons for the Room:
We were given 218 second floor. When asked by my wife about personal safes inside the room the gentleman lied about the ongoing installation not making it from the 3rd floor to the second floor yet.

Yes the building is old, yes it has recently been remodeled but, who ever completed the repairs and refurbishing of this hotel along with the people hired to manage the hotel along with managing contractors should be terminated for a crappy job.
House keeping non existing.
The rooms are poorly refurbished as open wall outlets with wires showing are very dangerous as you will see in my pictures.
The room floor was sticky like folks before us partied on it so we made sure not to walk bare foot in our room, 
The windows are dirty and have never been cleaned as you cannot see outside clearly, 
The TV has no remote and does not turn on.
The shower and tub was Janky and not cleaned when we arrived as it had hair from its last tenants all over it.
The toilet well, it never turned off after flushing as we hear the toilet run all night.
Speaking of the toilet, it never flushed properly so of course it finally got clogged. I was able to shut the water off. We called the front desk and the guy handed us a plunger at first.....
I was appalled by the actions of the man but with my wife insisting he reluctantly gave it his best.
As shown in my pictures the toilet over flowed the man insisted in turning the water back on and flushed the clogged toilet himself and flooded the bathroom.
He then offered to move us to an ""upgraded room""
On the third floor.
As the man walked out from the bathroom with plunger on hand as it drips all over the room floor my wife recommends that he not spread e-coli all over the room.
The man advises us to pack our stuff as he gets us another room.

Cons for Room 306
Next to parking garage and you will not get any sleep from either the cars or the busy alley below.
The TV was plugged into a stapled extension cord.
The lamp shade was damaged and old.
The window was filthy.
The bathroom sink from Homedepot.
The toilet was smaller and not better when flushing.
The carpet condition was yucky, wear shoes also.
The Tv work but only 1 channel.
TV remote on/off volume only.

As you can already tell we were not happy being in this hotel as we did our best to make the best out of our current temporary living arrangements.

My advise is if you are looking for a new clean quiet  hotel look outside the French quarters. 

If you want location and don't mind all the cons then yes this hotel might be for you.
But, just like all vacations you are gonna end up walking all over so you might as well get a hotel that your dollars gets the most for your bang.
As I would never stay or recommend this hotel to anyone I personally know.";27/03/2017 14:01

I could have made it at home or found the same at any diner.   It came with a side salad, which I appreciated, and will give high marks for the freshness of the greens, but the salad dressing was cloyingly sweet.

CGBOukokYuLEkWPJ4LgiMg;SBi0TYUSIrct8WSTyK6DFg;MUulT4nQqWBKuq0ZX2UZtg;5;4;1;0;"Absolutely loved my stay at the Hyatt House for a girls' weekend in NOLA. From the beginning of our stay at check-in, the staff was so welcoming and friendly. They truly went above and beyond and even upgraded our room to one on the top floor. Anghelique was a true gem and helped us out multiple times during our stay.

The hotel is set up a little differently than most, in that, you have to take an elevator immediately up to another level to check-in (floor 11). The check-in area is a brightly-colored, modern space that also provides complimentary fruit-infused water. On the same floor is also the breakfast area which is quite spacious.

Once we got to our room, we had a prime view of the superdome and pool area. Our room had two Queen sized beds with a large TV, desk, and a little seating nook. The bathroom had a large glass enclosed shower. 

The breakfast area and daily spread was a delightful surprise. The hotel provides free breakfast so I was expecting the typical sad array of bagels, muffins, and oatmeal. Hyatt House truly outperformed day after day with their breakfast. First of all, everything is laid out in an aesthically-pleasing way. All of the juices are in glass pitchers, all-white plates and coffee mugs. These are details that I appreciate. There is a made-to-order omelet bar where you place your order via pencil and paper and leave it with the cooks. There's a cereal box display of your usual options, breakfast meats that vary consisting of bacon, link sausage, scrambled eggs (I wasn't fan of the scrambled eggs - too watery), pancakes, oatmeal and grits, bagels, bread, fruit. As well as coffee and tea options. I can't stress how much the spread impressed us daily. There's also a crew that help keeps the area clean and everything refilled.

As for location of the hotel, it's located near all of the hot spots. Ten minute walk to Bourbon St, Jackson Square. Five minute walk to Canal st. There's also a trolley stop about twenty feet from the hotel that will take you up and down Canal, to the Garden district, etc.

The parking situation is something that we, thankfully, didn't have to deal with. We relied on our legs and uber. I do know that there's no designated parking garage for the hotel and that a valet service is available, however, I did notice a night or two where they had a sign out stating valet wasn't available so I would imagine that could/would cause issues.

If you ever find yourself in NOLA, I highly recommend the Hyatt House!";18/09/2016 20:27

I was with Cindy, and I got an SNS nail fill. She was fast, the nails were thin, light, and identically even, and it's been about 1 1/2 weeks and they look as perfect as ever. The location is a bit out of the way for me, but I am willing to  make the trip for her prices ($45 SNS set, $35 for a fill). They also do waxing, eyelash extensions, facials, and got new pedicure chairs, which I'm excited to try. :)

EDITED on 2/12/12: I now understand the review of DC, who said that they aren't very friendly. After a couple more visits I decided to try the individual eyelashes, and I was really disappointed. 

When she led me into the treatment room, nothing was set up and her children's coats and backpacks were all over the table I was supposed to lay on. She just sort of moved everything out of the way onto the floor, had me lay down, and didn't even turn on the lights while she applied the lashes. I could have forgiven all of this is she did a good job, but I looked like a transvestite once she was done, and they started coming off in clumps before I even got on the train. The next morning I woke up and huge areas were missing, I looked completely crazy and had to go through the painstaking process of removal with baby oil (kind of painful, btw). She used WAY too much glue, I don't think anyone has ever shown her the proper way to apply these. I called and she said I would get a credit (the treatment was $25) and when I came back in (with a friend!) she was kind of unpleasant to both of us and ended up only giving me a $15 credit. 

I am so bummed because when I first started going I was elated at how fast she was, what a good job she did, and her prices, but now I'm starting to see that she's letting herself get stretched too thin. She shouldn't offer most of the other treatments because she clearly doesn't have time for them, she should stick to manis, pedis, and eyebrow waxes IMO. I think she doesn't have enough help, so she has to rush through manis and leave other people waiting, and the quality of work has gone down plus customers are less satisfied (there was a woman getting a pedi when I came in, and she was soaking her feet and waiting the WHOLE time while my friend and I got our manis. I felt bad, she seemed really abandoned. The prices are good, but they ain't THAT good, I still want service).

Anyway, looks like I'm still searching for a reasonably priced nail salon in Philly that does SNS nails and has good customer service. Think I will try JFK nails next.";30/11/2011 17:26

The staff is super friendly and attentive.  Many of the waitstaff have been there for several years, so they are professionals.

The atmosphere cannot be beat.  If you can, make your reservations well in advance and request a table near the windows that overlook the bay - you can't beat the view at sunset (once when I was there, we witnessed an amazing thunderstorm out over the water)!  Most of the tables offer a lovely view, but the best seats in the house are nearest to the windows.

I highly recommend this place for Mother's Day brunch as well - we've done that 2 years in a row now and they truly offer the most amazingly fresh and extensive brunch I've ever seen offered anywhere.

Our first time did not match the 4 star rating on yelp and we probably should read reviews. Mac and cheese was overly flavored with truffle oil and disappointing, breakfast sandwich was bland even though it was hot, which was odd. The potatoes it came with were cold and only warm in some spots, and texture was like they had been sitting for awhile. We also ordered the burrata heirloom salad...tomatoes were unimpressive flavor and hard like they were not ripe. We paid 4 star prices for 2 star food. Service and ambience were fine.;11/02/2018 02:57

I ordered the Crab Padthai and it was soooooo yummy. At $18, it was a little expensive for take out, so I was really hoping it wouldn't disappoint and it certainly did not. The crab was fresh and not fishy tasting at all! They put a very good amount of crab too, large chunks everywhere. The pad Thai sauce was amazing and it was a good portion overall. 

I ordered for pick up and they were so quick! They told me 10 minutes so I left my house right after ordering. When I got there, my order was all ready to go! It was quick and easy and the staff there were very polite, both on the phone and in person.

Atmosphere: It's spacious, clean, and pleasant. I like that the tables are spread out so that you have lots of room.

Service: Good. We walked in and were soon greeted by the gentleman behind the bar. He said someone would be right with us, but it worked out that he sat us. Our server was a nice woman. Very attentive, and polite. Not pushy nor forgetful. So that's nice.

Food: Here's the rub. We went on a Monday night so my friend and I got the buy one get one on the Fish & Chips special. Good deal. For $1.99 more (apiece) we could add a soup or salad. Both of us got Clam Chowder. I don't like soup, except for Clam Chowder. But I shouldn't have assumed that would mean New England Clam Chowder, as I am originally from N.E. and that's all that exists to me. This was either Manhattan style, or pretty similar. I'm not sure what's typical for Irish places, but I was bummed to not get New England style. So we both ate about half by the time our Fish & Chips arrived and were ready to be done with it. The Fish & Chips looked great. And the chips were interesting as they appeared to be homemade, so props for that. Unfortunately I wasn't really a fan of the chips. And the fish looked great, but it just didn't seem to have any taste to it. I'm not sure if I'm just used to a more fried flavor, or salty taste, but this just seemed tasteless.";28/05/2013 22:44

But then something happened (I heard ownership changed) and the slices got instantly smaller and went up in price.  That would be enough to knock this review down to 3 stars.  I stopped going there, but since I'm always on Whyte, I sometimes do stop by for some pizza.  If you get a slice as soon as it comes out of the oven, the pizza (though small) is quite tasty, but lately I've been finding that the offered pieces have been sitting there for some time - and quite nasty.  If the pieces are not bought up right away, then they tend to get dry, crusty and stale quite fast....oops, lost a star.  And the final drop in the rating is attributed to the fact that I went in with a coupon from one of those students packs (buy one slice and get one free) and they refused to accept it.  The coupon was still valid - not out of date - and didn't state which locations it can be used at.  I'm a stickler for coupons (as I've gotten older, I've also gotten cheaper - just wait, it will happen to you!) so when the unhelpful lady behind the counter told me she wouldn't take it, I simply turned away - I kept my money and they kept their two slices - and I wandered over to the pizza place just around the corner.  It's too bad this location changed so much from how it was originally when it first opened.  I can remember line ups down the block at 2am - but then again, everyone was dressed in flannel and wearing Docs, so I guess that was quite some time ago.;06/11/2012 18:47

Went here for my birthday dinner and was disappointed to see that the menu looked like it had been chopped in half. 

We ordered the crab spinach dip to start and what looked like would be a decent serving because of the size of the dish ended up being like 4 TBS of dip with more crostini than there was dip for. OK I get it if you are trying to cut costs...but add a little more spinach so peeps don't feel like they are getting hosed on the price.

I had the tortellini with chicken and it was just OK...the chicken I feel like should have been prepped differently instead of a few sparing chunks thrown in. The serving size was decent and I took the rest home, it actually tasted better the next day, haha!

Just sad and disappointed that it this place seems to be faltering a bit...hopefully they 'll get it back for 2013!";02/01/2013 17:23

However, the second time was for dinner and we didn't finish any one of the three dishes we ordered. Aside from our server, who was again wonderful, the kitchen was definitely NOT on its A-game. The presentation of the plates bordering on sloppy was not what I had experienced the first time and every dish salted to an extreme.

You can get a double char, which is what I did the first time at the Milpas property, it's the same thing only it has 2 beef patties. To me the single char, which I had at the State St location, is just about perfect unless you really love meat.aAt the Milpas location I had the steak sandwich. I like the burger much better. The steak sandwich is a good size but is not trimmed of all the gristle, and I don't like gristle. I had to pick it out. 
The milk shakes are fantastic, nice an thick and full of flavor. My friends had the Albacore Tuna sandwich which was good and about the same size as the steak sandwich, the Cobb salad which was large enough for 2, and the grilled chicken sandwich. All were enthusiastically eaten and they had no complaints.
The Milpas location was a great place to eat, but plan on spending about 10 bucks per person by he time you add in fries and a drink. The State St locations food was just as good, but there were a lot of flies outside; I think it was because of the shade.

I didn't want to be ahead of anyone just didn't want to drive 3 miles to put my name in (when I was told the wait was 2 hours).

There were several items on the menu that I wanted to try, and settled on the BBQ pork shoulder (with ranch beans and cole slaw).  While not bad, it just didn't do it for me, but I'm from the South and have certain standards and expectations when it comes to BBQ.  I typically wouldn't order BBQ in AZ, but was intrigued because they smoke it with pecan wood. Pork was as ok, sauce was mediocre, beans were mushy, and cole slaw was good.

Florida and town was overrun with Gators fans.  We were seated very late and the restaurant looked like a drunken good ol' boy fraternity reunion.  By this i mean it was loud!!!!  I asked my waiter if it was always this loud or were most of the other tables in fact screaming.  He said it was the latter, but didn't do a damn thing about it.  Oh well, i chose not to leave so . . .

On to the food.  For two we ordered Wood Roasted Oysters, Duck Confit Pizza with Fried Egg, Mussels in Chardonnay Broth, Goat Cheese-strawberry salad, and side of Cheddar Grits.  The waiter and I spoke about how to bring the food out and then to my surprise it all arrived at once.  Yikes.  The problem was rectified quickly though and apologies all around.

Oysters were good as two or three were included in each hole of the cast iron serving dish.  Nice that the broth was not overpoweringly garlic/butter flavor (ala Acme).  So we could taste the oysters and the liquid retained a briny flavor.

Mussels were good too as the broth was also redolent of the sea and the wine, while not being too garlicky and buttery.  Nice and light.

Pizza disappointed a bit as the dough was delicious but the fried egg was pretty well done and there was no yolk to ooze over the duck and crust.  Truffle oil was a nice touch though my wife didn't care for the flavor.

The salad was very good and stood out for its unique dressing, which we inquired about.  The waiter claimed it was a strawberry balsamic.  Didn't taste like it and upon leaving checked the specials board to find out it was a Cane Syrup-Brown butter vinaigrette.  Very tasty, sweet and nutty.  the grits were darn good but i would bet that was due to copious amounts of butter (and maybe cream too).  Not the kind you'd make at home but I guess thats the point.

For dessert we had the banana pudding cake, with drunken monkey ice cream.  Ice cream was very good, cake about what you'd expect.  
Would return for the food but the atmosphere was not conducive to a couples night out . . . unless you showed up rip roaring drunk and enjoy screaming to heard.";13/10/2009 16:30

It's really close to both the expressway and 42. It's located inside of Virtua, which makes the GPS directions a little confusing. I had to drive around the parking lot and ended up asking the security guard.

They make appointments and also accept walk-in. I stopped by as a walk-in and was taken almost immediately. The salon was very clean, bright and modern. The ladies at the front desk were friendly and professional. 

Lisa was great. Before starting, she asked me exactly what I wanted done. The waxing was done in a chair (versus laying down on a table), and it was as quick and painless as an eyebrow waxing could be. Before I knew it, the service was over and it was exactly what I wanted.  

Pro-tip: your first service at Rizzieri is 20% off. It made this market-price service very inexpensive. They have an ATM onsite if you don't have cash for tips.

Our group ordered garlic bread and roma bread as appetizers.  The garlic bread was wonderful but the roma bread didn't really taste like anything (then again, it's more of a dipping bread), the herbed marinara that came with the roma bread was to die for, as was their ranch dressing - THE BEST we've ever had in any restaurant.

We ordered a cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and The Bomb (vegetarian with pepperoni and sausage).  Each of them were delicious and heated up beautifully the next day as leftovers.

n1cf6-gOI7MvKE2PvC_rwg;EBc-X5eaVjCRNPNMy0H1UQ;FxOiQuDGEue-Fno5-ZKEow;2;6;0;0;"After reading the excellent reviews we stopped in for dinner here looking forward to Japanese grill. After sitting down we were disappointed to find out that they did not have their liquor license yet. Not a big deal. We were also told that they did not actually have any grilled options yet as this was their soft opening, a fact that was not advertised anywhere else. Again a bit disappointed we decided to try out the ramen only to find out they also did not have any ramen yet. This was odd to hear after reading several reviews describing how delicious the ramen was...

Disheartened and left with a fairly limited remaining menu, we ordered a few starters and a couple bentos. The beef done arrived with good presentation but barely enough beef to cover the rice. The ""Chef's Choice"" bento had a few pieces of fried sushi (which had no identifiable meat), two small nigiri and an adorable onigiri. Unfortunately the onigiri had nothing inside (again despite previous reviews showing filled onigiri) and we were informed they would be filled next week (??) but were still charged regular price for the bento. 

In summary, a lack of upfront communication about menu item availability and unapologetic, incomplete dishes lead to an underwhelming dinner experience. An accurate soft opening menu and frank description of what is available and content of the dishes would be appreciated in the future. Also maybe don't put up signs all over the restaurant advertising your 10hr ramen broth when it isn't available yet.";11/02/2018 04:04

Excellent prices for the amount of food you get, service is always super speedy and we never wait long for a table- even when we come in with a huge group of two families.

The wine was not only something other than La Crema, but not even a Chardonnay.  I was in a bit of a rush, so I drank it anyway.  I advised the wait person, who I know was not at fault, that the wine was either a Pinot Gregio(sp) or a poor quality Sav Blanc.  She apologized, but there was nothing she could do.  The food was just fine, if not excellent, but the wine was an absolute disappointment and the bartender that poured should be made aware that not all people that order a wine are clueless.  If I choose Flowing Tide in the future I want to watch the bartender pour my drink!

It was mostly empty, but got progressively busier as my visit went on. I received a warm welcome from a nice hostess, Claudia, who invited me to take a seat anywhere I liked. She handed me a menu and offered me beverages. I'm pretty boring, I always get water, lemon, no ice. She came back with my water, and along with it, homemade chips and salsa, and lime halves. Squeeze the limes over the chips, then dip. It's ritual! The salsa was very tasty and the right amount of heat, although I'm one who enjoys nice kicks to all my foods, so it may come off as spicy to some. I'm sure they can accommodate if you ask, because they are so nice! And finally, the water actually was filtered, thank you sweet baby Jesus.

I wasn't ravenous this afternoon, so I decided to order something on the smaller side: quesadilla de marlin. I've had caramelos with asada, and chevindeca con birria, but never with fish, so I ventured! They also serve breakfast items, like huevos rancheros and classic chilaquiles, which run about the $7-9 range and entrees looked about the usual for a mariscos spot, about $14-20. There was even a seafood and steak family platter that ran for $45. My quesadilla was $7. There's something on the menu for all budgets.

It took about 10 minutes for my food to come out, but very much worth the wait, even for a little guy: the quesadilla was made from corn tortillas which is expected from a chevindeca but not a quesadilla or caramelo, but I prefer corn anyway, and they were toasted perfectly to me! The cheese oozed - do not expect this cheese to be Guero's or BK's cheese, there's definitely no comparison possible! And when I finally picked it up, juice began to drip and I was convinced it would be the highlight of my day after my first bite. The marlin, peppers, onions, and tomatoes must have been sitting in the juice for hours, just an incredible medley. I can tell you that there's not one thing that made this quesadilla, it's the entire thing! 

While I was eating, I was able to meet the owner of the restaurant, Martin, I believe. Such a warm-hearted guy, he reached out to shake my hand with both his hands! Muy buena gente and only cared about how my visit there was going. They have 2 locations in Sonora I believe, one in Rio Rico, another in Nogales, and this one on Prince is their newest. I wish them the best in their growth, hopefully Phoenix will get one in the future bc La Bocanita's the TRUTH!

I will surely be returning with friends and family and trying out different menu items, and what is more, recommending this over Mariscos Chihuahua, hands down!

P.S. Ambiance is on the classy side but still holds its Mexican style. They play Latin music, a variety of rancheras and Spanish pop. They have a small stage as well, so expect live performances during dinner on a weekend.";13/05/2017 04:07

The baked goods are absolutely top-notch... lots of real butter, fresh ingredients, and hand decoration.  At a fateful birthday party 7 or 8 years ago, I picked up a piece of cake without paying much attention to it, and soon after was seeking out the host to find out where the heck she got it.  (It was a pumpkin cake of some kind with orange-flavored buttercream, as I recall.)  Since then, I've been a Jazmine addict.  If you have any interest in things sweet potato related, you will never find better cheesecake/muffin/cake/pie etc. in that vein.  

The owner, Kim, who my children refer to as ""Sweet Jazmine,"" is super talented and committed, and it shows in her work.  It's very much a small, owner-operated business in that every customer matters, but it's not like you can go in there without notice and expect an endless inventory of every single thing they make.

It's in the New Olreans Lager and Ale Brewing building.  I placed my order and paid.  Then I realized that I didn't order a drink.  I asked the girl behind the counter for a coke.  She said I needed to order at the bar.  So I went over and ordered two cokes for my friend and I.  The bartender open'd the two cokes and then he told me it was a $10.00 min.  Are you kidding!  I don't drink and neither does my friend.  I was outraged to say the least.  I gave the bar tender a hard time and then grabbed a water from  the cooler up front.  I then told the girl behind the counter that she should have told us about the ten dollar min before.  She said she didn't know about it.  That's a bunch of bull.  She said they were a separate business.  Very disappointed!  I do have to say thought that the ribs are very good.  That's the only reason I gave it 3 stars.

So let's pretend there wasn't a time in 2003 where Mojo had ridiculously good hot wings and access to the widest selection of brews west of I-65. Those days are gone and Nashville's dining and drinking scene have improved dramatically on both fronts - go us!

I stopped by recently for lunch with a friend. I'm not a food preparation expert but I'm pretty sure that you can't actually make crawfish etouffee and rice in less than 3 minutes. While I was pleased (in an existential sense) by the ultra-quick delivery of our food it really had that ""fresh from the microwave"" flavor and texture.

The main goal of the Mojo Grill's seating area seems to be making you wish you were on the other side having a beer.  Given the insane scalding temperature of my micro-utfee (see what I did there? Sorry.) I wished that I did have a beer to restore balance to my taste-buds.  But sadly for me and this review, it was 11:30 am on a Tuesday.";18/03/2013 18:02

But I'd have to say it's their SERVICE that will keep me from returning ever again.  I'm not a huge consumer of these products, but maybe 2-3 times a year I'll drop a $100 each time.  About a year ago I received a % coupon from Sephora.  I had a few other errands to run in the same center as ULTA so I brought my Sephora coupon  along and asked if they'd honor the competitor coupon for the same products.  ""No-"" was their curt answer.  There was no offer or suggestion of maybe what they ""could"" do otherwise to earn my business. Just, ""No"" and a stare.   I left, and went to Sephora, who earned my money. Out of convience, I had other shopping to do in this same strip mall, once again.  I grabbed a cart and knocked off each errand along this outside mall while loading each purchase bag I made in the same cart (I know I was cart-double-dipping-lol!)  I also was carrying my 10 month old son in this cart as well (multi-tasking!)  I was ready to give ULTA another try.  As I was browsing the new fall nail colors, a somewhat stern blonde employee quickly approached me and asked me to please leave with my cart.  She explained that although she saw I was pushing an infant and was hauling other bags that their ""shelves were not designed nor sturdy enough in the event I pushed into one with my cart"".  Maybe if she had offered to hold my bags behind the counter, or helped me with my purchases while I used my hands to hold my son, I would have stayed.  But again, there was NO effort made to keep or earn my dollar.  There was no apology for the situation.  Not even a half-ass compassion attempt.  My happy little boy, wallet and I walked our butt out of ULTA for the very last time.  (While passing a woman and her baby in a stroller- so how is THAT exactly less of a shelf hazard than the cart I was pushing???) 
Especially in todays economy it's no excuse to be this poor with customer service.  Thank goodness for capitalism. And thank goodness for the Sally Beauty Supply next door to ULTA.  Not only was my purchase less expensive there but  they were very helpful in helping me (and the cart I was pushing!) find my needed products.";08/10/2010 01:26

I was SO lucky, however, to find Chris! I have never had such good luck before with a random google search! Chris is a truly talented photographer, and is very accessible. He was able to schedule me ASAP and a few days later, my retouched photograph is on my desktop ready to be uploaded to all my websites. I did the basic $99 session, which is perfect for a quick corporate headshot. He dropboxed me the photos that same night, and I had 26 photos to choose from (he will retouch your favorite one and make you look flawless, seriously).  But you still get to KEEP all of the others ones in that dropbox folder (which is good just to have) because he's awesome and doesn't brand them with a logo all over them or anything. My only tip for someone getting this package is to make sure you take ample photos ! In a few of them, my hair was not to my particular liking (crazy girl, I know), so I wish I would have checked in the mirror in the middle of the shots to just check that my hair was still in proper place. Chris even offered to do a reshoot for me at a discounted rate, if I could not find a shot that I loved (told you, crazy girl about my hair) -- but with his talent, I was able to choose one that's perfect. He gives you the full 30 minutes to use and will take as many shots as you want! Take advantage of that. The studio is adorable and there's a full bathroom with a full length mirror there to touch up hair/makeup if the Philly weather kicks your butt on the way in.

My sides were Red potatoes and some Southern Greens. It comes with slice of bread and pickles.  The bread to calm the burn I'm sure.
     There's tables and picnic benches inside with lots of window lighting.  The guy behind me ordered up the Damn Hot and two beers and he was sweating like he ran a marathon.

We wanted to order bourbon, and when we asked the first guy behind the bar, he pointed vaguely at the bottles and said ""Here they are"" and then walked away.
We later asked the bartender for a new list, and he said he would look for one. He then walked outside and when he came back, he never told us what was available or if there was a clear list. In fact he didn't speak to is again. 
We were then basically ignored at the bar and left shortly after our food. We would have happily stayed there  to drink, had the service not been so dismal.

Their wings are also really good. They recently added some new flavors so i'll have to give them a whirl.
My favorite thing on their menu is the Double Porker Sandwich. It's a homemade spicy BBQ pulled pork topped with bacon ( I opt no cheese on mine). If you like pulled pork give this sandwich.";25/09/2014 15:32

When I entered, I was promptly greeted by their staff and was escorted upstairs to a pedicure chair. The pedicure pedicure was exactly what I expected and worth what they charged for it. However, the manicure sucked. I felt rushed because they did the manicure while I was still in the pedicure chair. They weren't busy and they had manicure stations open...so I don't understand why they had it organized this way. Also the quality of the manicure was horrible. She didn't finish the tips of my nails...so they chipped the very next day.

I won't be back to visit. Even though this spa appears nicer on the outside that other nearby spas, the quality is subpar and just not worth the money.";30/11/2014 02:04

Facility: still sub-par

This IHOP re-opened a few days ago after ""voluntarily"" closing down for two months to make health code related repairs.  Building is cold, not sure the heat is on.  Overheard staff say a pipe had froze over night and they had no water and that the owner was aware (for several hours).  However; no plumber was on site.  Eventually I heard a staff member say that they were going to close for the day due to no water.  

Not sure a manager was on duty.  I hardly ate my food but no one asked if anything was wrong with the food.  Did I mention the syrup on the table was frozen?  Frozen.  I went to pour the full bottle of strawberry syrup on my pancakes...and nothing came out.  The server noticed and then gave me some heated up syrup in a paper cup.  

I thought that since the heat was most likely off and no water that maybe my meal would be comp'd or offered a discount?  I wasn't really expecting a free meal (food was good...was too cold in the building), but the offer would have gone a long way. Staff is working the best they can with what they got.  With that said, I'm pretty sure doors shouldn't have opened  today with no water.

I had expected significant changes to the interior, but was surprised that very few changes were made.

This is the last visit I'll make to this IHOP until they tear it down and build a new one.

They finally opened during the course of the week leading up to Mardi Gras, and I couldn't be more excited for it. 

Walking into the Magasin, you'll get a very upscale, trendy vibe to the place. Everything is sleek and new, and quite impressive. I'm a fan of their lighting, but that's another story. 

I was salivating at the menu upon first glance. I settled on their Pho my first go around, and I was so very satisfied. Their presentation is flawless, and their amazing food just makes the whole experience even more delightful. Yes, they may only have one size to their Pho bowls, but to be honest, that could be the least of my concerns. I've since gone back and tried numerous menu items - among my favorites are the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, the Grilled Shrimp Spring Rolls, and the BBQ Pork Vermicelli Noodle Bowl. Tasty, Tasty, Tasty. 

At the moment, they're still in their first few weeks of being open. They have a delightful owner (who even let my roomie and I be served before they opened for dinner the other day!), and staff who are very eager and apologetic for mistakes made. I haven't had a problem waiting for my food, as all of the times I have gone there, my food has been brought to me in under 10 minutes. I've had to wait longer at numerous other restaurants, so I don't see the wait for food as an issue. 

Cost wise, Magasin is super affordable, with most meals costing under $10. I love meals that don't break my bank and Magasin caters to these needs. 

A few tips - Magasin is BYOB (no corking fees), they do take-out, avoid the busy hours of the day (i.e. 12pm, 6-7ish). I haven't had a problem yet rolling in around 5:30, right when they start up dinner, or a little after the lunch crowd. 

To make a long story short, this is my new go to Pho shop. It may not be like those Pho shops on the westbank, but I've fallen in love with Magasin, and will continue to visit this darling shop frequently. I've been going back continually, and quite frankly, you should give it a shot.";01/03/2012 08:30

The Pho noodles were excellent, but a little strong on the flavor of the broth, I enjoy a more light flavor that I can doctor up depending on my mood though.  
The tables in the seating area were way too small, so much so that a party of four regularly sized individuals seriously cannot sit comfortably at the table. But the dining area is lovely (just needs more comfortable seating). 
The service was the biggest disappointment as they were too busy chatting in the kitchen and not paying attention to their customers. At one point I had to express ""excuse me"" loudly to get their attention.

It seems like it's all milk! 

Today our service was extra bad. The manager seemed out of it. She was slurring her words and not helping anyone in line.

Even if you're on your own, it would still be romantic.  It's a lovely little pink building just 2-3 blocks away from Bourbon Street.  Gated parking, a nice little patio area in back where breakfast is served (which is perfect for either writing or just enjoying the ambiance), wonderful, very helpful staff that helps you to navigate more ""local"" New Orleans, and just immaculate and charming.  

The place is full of personality.  Very artsy with great decor.  The bedrooms are just wonderful.  I love the location: Just enough away from the craziness, but a pleasant walk to and from.  It's right next to Louis Armstrong Park.

We only stayed one night, but I loved the location, the Bohemian charm, and the wonderful and friendly staff.  Next time I find myself in New Orleans, they will definitely have my business again.";09/09/2014 18:32

Outside of the restaurant it looks like an upscale restaurant. However, upon entering you walk into a casual seat yourself arrangement where you order at the counter and the staff bring the food out to you on paper plates and in paper bowls. I ordered the roasted chicken which comes with 2 sides. I ordered the blue cornmeal cornbread as one side and the mashed potatoes as the other. When I requested the roasted chicken the owner, I'm assuming Miguel, informed me that the chicken would be a little pink, but not to worry as he ate it yesterday and was still alive. I wanted to change my order after that sales tactic. When it arrived it was a slight pink tint and I was too put off after the warning that I couldn't get myself to eat more than a couple of bites. My friend got the mac and cheese and the jambalaya. He said the jambalaya was good, but the mac and cheese was not good. It tasted like boiled elbow macaroni with a little cheddar cheese sprinkled on top. Very bland. The blue cornmeal cornbread had a distinct peppery taste, which was not mentioned on the description. It was tolerable, but nothing to write home about. Needless to say, I didn't come close to finishing my meal here. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.;28/05/2012 20:29

The restaurant was clean and quiet so great for conversations at your own table.  It is located at Southgate mall but with no access from the inside of the mall and has a huge parking lot.

The brunch menu items sounded delicious and mimosas were also available.  Two of my friends shared the banana bread French toast and the Benny and they were able to get it split in half on to their own plates from the kitchen.  The homefries looked so good sprinkled with what looked like seasoning salt.  The dill dip for the fries was very tasty as the gravy (I tried both).  The teriyaki chicken bowl came with lots of sauce so one friend asked for extra rice, it was an additional $2.50 but she got lots.

They also have a great sense of humor.  If you have to wait there for work to get done, the potential conversations won't be boring.

We got shredded beef taquitos which were cooked perfectly and delicious. And we also got some bean dip to go with our chips and salsa which was interesting because they layered the beans in on top of salsa verde which is the way I personally do it at home.

The food was good but not great. Rather limited menu for me. Had the beet salad with goat fried cheese balls. Strangely, the cheese inside the fried balls was almost gone! Probably over fried. Had the chicken, which wasn't bad but not exceptional. Want good chicken? Go to Bandera in Scottsdale. Best I ever had. Wife had trout and her comment was it was overly complicated. Again fried oysters where overly breaded and overly done. On the other hand the wine service was great and a nice selection of diverse wines, reasonably priced. The waiters where all attentive and a good team approach to service.

We tried a variety of shakes and boy do you need a crazy metabolism to digest these heavy shakes. The peanut-butter chocolate shake was crazy delicious and can't think about anything that'd make it better (maybe a shot of Captain Morgan?). However, their speciality shake of white chocolate and avocado was pretty okay. Avocado seems too mild, in my opinion, to have it with a bold and sweet white chocolate.

All in all, it was a fun experience. If it had the pull of getting me back there some time, I'd give it a 4 star but sadly it doesn't. Some good things, in particular a juicy patty, but some ordinary things too.";21/02/2013 20:16

Nice little well-appointed clean rooms with pleasing design and everything functional.  Good bathroom, nice showers. Nice little complimentary breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. What's more, as I discovered later they have all of the Chaplin movies on hand for you to watch on the in-room DVD! HBO and such provided on the box in the room as well as a great little digital radio which I thought was a nice touch.

The building is very solidly built and just over 100 years old.

We had great fun soaking in the outdoor hot-tub Jacuzzi and swim in the pool.

My only complaint is that the front desk guys are not very helpful, they appear to be quite miserable and nasty. Hence the shave-off of stars.

When we arrived, well ahead of time at 2:30 pm I asked for a quiet room, knowing that the building is literally next to the 101 FWY and a major intersection as well. These weren't around in the 20's when the Inn was built... So, it's a shame but there's the 21st century for you... Anyway... The hotel was clearly half -empty on a Sunday, with 4 cars in the parking lot so there was plenty of options to choose from as far as rooms. Sure enough the front-desk guy say ""I have the QUIETEST room in the hotel"" and proceeded to put us into a room right above the intersection. So, the night and morning was noisy.  Why did he do that and why does he take me for an idiot? It remains a mystery...

I got the spicy potato salad as my side. I liked it but thought it was a little salty. My husband got the Angus burger and fries and also thought it was good but nothing special. After we left though he said that he hated that the food was served on those plastic melamine plates.

here's the deal: we are adopting two older children from china, each with special needs: one has only physical needs and the other cognitive delay. we are in the midst of setting up bedrooms and fixing a new guest room (since our previous guest room is now one of the children's bedroom), and also, the table in our breakfast room is not what we want when they come home. we also need a table for them to do homework and crafts at. we also personally were wishing and dreaming for a headboard and footboard for us (we haven't had a real bed with said headboard and footboard in the 2 years we've been married). 

we found the daybed with trundle for the guest room, and began talking to her about our story, and the adoption, she told us about how she had lived abroad and worked issuing visas for newly adopted children as well. 

we shared with her our plight of our completely different design ideology and she spent well over an hour with us helping us decide on the perfect balance of function and aesthetic. 

when we left, we had the perfect headboard/footboard for our bedroom, a daybed with trundle for the new guest room, an awesome small dresser for storage for the new guest room, and our dream table/homework craft area.

I went this morning around 10am, no wait, which was great. It is tucked away in the first floor of an apartment/loft complex. Parking for Estelle is minimal, they have about 5 spots total for customers. So, we parked on street (note: must pay meter via coins, no kiosk booth to pay via card. Yes, you must pay even on a Sunday).

The food was simply bland, dry, and a tad unedible. And I am not saying this because I already have a breakfast place I am loyal to. I had a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich. You can get it on their own roll (aka dry thick sour dough like bread) or bagel. I could only eat half of it. I was amazed -how can you mess up a breakfast sandwich? The eggs were not fluffy, and they added some weird herb to it to give it an ""off"" taste. There were two small pieces of bacon, and barely any cheese on it. All together, I'd rate a 1.

My date got the beet, cheese, onion omelet. It came with homefries, with his were in need of some serious seasoning, and wheat toast, which was literally was like eating grains. He did enjoy his coffee though. Coffee situation was odd though. Although we had a server, you had to go up to the counter to pour your own. Not necessarily a negative, just different.

I would definitely go back for the s'mores ravioli for dessert, but that's probably it.  

As others have mentioned, we also had a Living Social deal and, yes, it was very deceptive.  As the deal stated, the $100 should have covered all 4 of us (without drinks, tax, and tip), but they just took it off the total bill.

I rely a lot on email for communication, as do most people!  Thanh always responds SO fast and timely.  That is the life saver.  He is always there when I call too.  

So far, he's helped w/ insuring jewelry and my bike (yes, I'm skeptical about Philly here for stolen property) and I live in Old City (fairly safe IMO and I came from SF ya'll). 

There was even a discrepancy w/ a car rental where I received a flat tire and he was able to seamlessly help me out and make a claim so that I am refunded for any out of pocket expense.  I would say I email/bug him enough as a client, but you know, I like to keep my car and my property safe and insured... You take care of your car, he'll take care of you!

Pictures and descriptions can't do it justice. I believe it's open year round. I've been there on the hottest of hot humid days and it's still a pleasure. There are different areas that feature gardens you'd find in other countries. There is a rose garden. There's a garden just for hostas! There are several indoor areas featuring plants from desert and rain forest regions. The landscaping and maintenance are unmatched. There are structures that are beautiful and artful and stunning architecturally. It is a huge park! Birds and animals are there. There's also art and people to answer questions. Signs to tell you more about the gardens. I have to say I don't like the tram driving around. It gets in the way and you sometimes have to literally jump aside. The driver does not yield to people on foot and they are loud, going places they should stay out of. But this is the price you pay for such an earth shattering experience.

There was singing from the moment we arrived until we ordered dessert when they took a break.  The mousse cake is DELICIOUS and I still dream about it.  

Second experience:  June 2012, Saturday night.  A friend from out of tow and her musical loving children took me out for my birthday here.  I ordered all of the same food and it was all still delicious, especially that mousse cake.  I was called up for a birthday shot and there was singing again, throughout the night.  

Third experience:  September 2012, Saturday night.  A friend heard about the June experience and wanted to go.  We arrived at 8pm and had to ask to be seated somewhere that wasn't behind the mirrored post.  When we asked to sit in the main room right in front of the stage, we were told the tables were reserved.  NO ONE SAT THERE ALL NIGHT.  Our food and service were great, again the papardelle.  My friend ordered the Grouper Special and reported that it was good.  We asked when the entertainment would be begin and were told ""in 5 minutes"".  About 30 minutes later, at 9, we were entertained by 20-30 minutes of music.  It was great but then they took a ""brief break"" which involved the piano player walking around drinking soda FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.  My friend was determined to stay for a second set to hear our fabulous waiter, David, sing.  At 10:30 we were treated to another 15 minutes of music and then another ""brief break.""  I was not interested in waiting around any longer.  While waiting, the lovely proprieter of the establishment came around to ask how the food was.  He handed us a card, which we thought was a coupon, and were excited about.  When we realized it was his business card, we were disappointed and confused.  

The food is good but the entertainment is the reason to go.  

All in all, I would go here again and would recommend it to others but now with a caveat just in case people don't have 3 hours to spend sitting around to wait for the entire reason they came to the establishment in the first place.";10/09/2012 15:22

Ordered a gluten-free ginger beer and was served a wheat beer with a ginger essence. After taking a couple of drinks, I told waitress it was wrong. She casually said they were out of the ginger beer I ordered and that they were serving that beer (on their menu) for ginger. They just substituted without informing me (.25 more, too ) Luckily, I have no known gluten intolerance.  She did take it off bill when reminded.

The baked beans were good which is why they get 2 stars, the mac n cheese was bland with very little flavor.  

If you like barbeque I would pass on this place. You get way better tasting food for cheaper at Big Mikes BBQ on Sheldon Rd. Like I said I really wanted this place to be good as it looks like a nice place but the food just didn't deliver.  I won't be coming back.";15/04/2018 18:50

I was recommended a sandwich with pork roast on it. I had no idea what to expect, but it was delicious. The meat was so tender, great flavor just on its own but the toppings brought the sandwich together. It was a bit creamy and had some crunch to it as well. 

Did I mention the bread was amazing? Because it was. I've never had bread like that. It was reminiscent of a panini, but not toast. The crust was a thin crispy crust that gave great texture but was very easy to eat. The inside of the bread was soft and held the ingredients in their place.

I had found this place on Yelp and I saw the sign for Cochon. But, it just didn't seem right. So, I pulled up my iYelp and saw the sign for this place and saw that I just needed to walk a few feet down the way to the Butcher sign. 

We had originally come for the bacon pralines but decided to get a little lunch/snack while here. After all, they boast mac and cheese which my boyfriend and I are both huge fans of. 

So, we ordered the mac and cheese and the duck sliders to share. We tried to order the pralines but were told they were sold out and next time to come back earlier (we arrived at 11). Not enjoying pralines, I wasn't too upset except that this was the whole reason we came. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was devastated. Two of his most favorite things in the world, bacon and praline, were denied to him. And we knew we would never get back to this place, let alone EARLIER, due to the things we already had planned. 

The duck slider was good. Cheesy, salty, toasted, and delicious. The only let down was the size for the price. We both really enjoyed the mac and cheese except we both decided it was more of a cheese pasta dish as it had so many additions that we couldn't classify it as a true mac and cheese. But, we both also agreed it was one of the best cheese pasta dishes we have had. Also a let down for the price though. 

If I could have gotten my boyfriend a bacon praline and not spent close to $20 bucks for two sodas and some snacks I would have rated this place higher.";29/06/2011 20:15

Obi-wan-Kenobi (Steve E.) was nice enough to introduce me to this place. Once again, some of the best places I found in Tampa are in a strip shopping center very unpromising and over delivering. Unless recommended by a friend or Yelp, there is no reason for me to come from Riverview to 2202 Waters and try some Chinese food...but it was so good!

We ordered one appetizer: Salt and Pepper Calamari. That could have been my meal! It was so good. The batter was crispy and the spices were perfect (green onions, red pepper flakes and other bits of deliciousness). Then we ordered three entrees: shrimp fried rice, black pepper beef and shrimp with Chinese greens. Steve kept saying that we ordered enough to take home and eat the next day, and I agreed. When they served the food on the table I thought that we definitely were going to have leftovers for the next two days...but I gave the first bite and my paradigm shifted. 

In every dish I had this savory feeling that the only adjective that comes to mind is: right! The salt was right!, the spice was right! the crunchiness was right! the brightness on the greens was right! many delicious Chinese places I've been to are greasy...the grease was right! a lot of rights make perfect in my opinion.

Yes, we had leftovers, not as much as I thought when I saw the plates but we had enough to make two small boxes to go. Steve assured me that he was going to have that for the next day. I, in a very naïve state of mind, thought the same. 

We happily paid the bill  (around $40 for everything) that I thought it was more than fair for the great experience with my new friend, and we proceeded to go to the Got Tea place a couple of business down in the same shopping center. We parted ways happily, I went to a work appointment and I got home at 11 pm.

Little I knew that the box that I stuffed at Yummy house had learned my name and whispered it in my ear at midnight. Like responding to a mermaid call, I got up and finished what I started a couple of hours earlier. No reflux, no nightmares, no regrets....just happiness.

Burger was cooked perfect, had great flavor and the bun was soft - 8/10

Mussels appetizer -  Mussels were about 3-4 days past their prime.  Had a ""fishy"" taste to them.  inedible. 1/10.

Service - our waiter was nice, mostly attentive.  however when it came time to pay the bill, I had to bring the check/credit card to him.

Looks like Porterhouse is succumbing to state of the economy.  It is sad to see a place that was probably once great, slack on their food quality etc.  Even with a good burger, I am sticking with the 1 star review due to the mussels, service, and website.";27/10/2011 12:45

I first noticed the decor and the ambiance of the restaurant. It had a very relaxing atmosphere. The lights were dimmed and the small cocktail lounge worked well. The staff was pretty average. From the hostess to the waiter, there wasn't anything that set them apart from other servers. They were both professional and nice, but not very talkative at all. Just kind of all business. The food took a little long to come out, but when it did, it was so delicious. I ordered the Japanese Lunch Box which came with so much food. My friend ordered the tuna with mashed yams and plantains. Overall, a great restaurant. The price wasn't too bad for the food that we ordered. Just a bit over $40 for the two of us without any appetizers or extras. I'd definitely go back.;16/08/2017 15:35

So my guy and I walked into the museum around 4pm on a Saturday. We were in a rush because we knew we only had an hour to walk in the museum. We were told to stop by and get a map at the front. There was an older gentleman there who greeted us by asking who we were voting for. Not sure if that question is asked to all that walk by those doors, or we just got lucky. We didn't want to answer as we figured, being in Tennessee, we were most likely not voting for the same candidate. We brushed off the question and he asked again. We made a joke of it and answered. He mumbled something under his breath and then laughed and said, ""I'm just kidding, not you guys."" He did this a few times before asking us why we were voting the way we were. I wanted to make him aware of our backgrounds and II jokingly told him that Trump is trying to get rid of our people. Again, he mumbles something under his breath and said ""he was just kidding."" He then proceeded to say that we were already in the country anyway and that his concern were the immigrants. At this point, it was no longer funny and I just wanted to get the map so we could go on our way. My guy quickly cut him off and asked for the map. The man finally gave us the map with a few directions and we were off. This experience is the reason I deducted a star. 

Once inside, I forgot about what had just happened and got lost all the information the museum had to offer. The videos, the displays and the newspapers of that time, really help you understand that period in time. While it is interesting, it is all very sad and am so glad a lot of changes have been made since then. I am obviously familiar with the Civil War, but being there put me on another level. I wish we had given ourselves more time to roam three floors. There is so much to see and you will find yourself losing track of time because you are so wrapped up in a video, on a portrait or on an actual artifact. 

I truly enjoyed everything this FREE museum had to offer, but the older gentleman at the front should maybe just stick to greeting people and not give his political opinion. 


Yeah, I'd go again.";12/08/2016 21:55

I look at it as I pay more for the fact that I get socialize my dog while shopping for his needs. Almost gave them 2 or 1 stars because of the staff/services. 

The staff are okay. A bit pushy to sell you a puppy starter kit. Some are very nice and helpful, others are just interested in your dog. A bit misleading also, sold me what I was told was a ""bull tendon"" that's great for chewing on. Bought my puppy another one and actually read the label - it's a ""bull pizzle"". I'll let you look up what that is, but I'm a little annoyed that was generalized as a ""tendon"". 

Will never utilize their services again - was told their puppy play time was for puppies and free, after I got in ""the ring"" I found out there were 9 year old dogs and a $10 a person charge. There were about 10+ dogs and 15+ people in the little training area they have - very crowded for dogs that are not familiar with one another in my opinion.

Hiroba has great sushi, but the noise level and elbow-bumping make it not great for actually enjoying the company of your dinner guests.

I ordered the ravioli and the rice/prosciutto appetizer. Both were super delicious. The app was 2 big pieces. Nice size but a little on the pricier side. 
The ravioli were 6 giant round ravioli. At first I was like that's it?? But it was totally enough for me to have 2 meals. Both the app and the ravioli came in a kind of blush sauce and it was delicious though if I were to have eaten there I would have asked for an extra side of sauce as it needed a little more in my opinion plus I would've liked some to dunk my bread in (they give you a nice hunk of really yummy bread). 
My only concern is that I thought I read in other reviews that entrees come with soup or salad...I definitely didn't get any of that.

Makeup lesson - like every other girl around, I've obviously been wearing makeup for years and thought I knew how to put it on.  Who hasn't tried to follow those diagrams in magazines which tell you how to apply eyeshadow for ""day"" and ""smokey eyes"", right?  Well it turns out I wasn't clueless, but I definitely learned a trick or two which really makes my makeup look great.  Also, she doesn't push products on your at all during the lesson, but you definitely might want to buy a few of the things, such as foundation.  This is also like a professional foundation matching session.  Recently she changed her brand of foundation and the one I'd been using was discontinued.  After I purchased the replacement, I discovered at home it was too dark.  I contacted Ursula and she immediately arranged for me to come back and get something that would make me happy.  The one we chose was even better than the original and I left there super satisfied.

Facial - what can I say about Elina and the facial that hasn't already been said below?  It's a one-of-a-kind experience and Elina is obviously a pro.  Try it at least once.  There are differnet combos, but go with the one with the scalp massage.  Of course that's the best choice.

Massage - I am pretty sure they don't have these anymore, but I got a few from Elina maybe a year or two ago and they were wonderful.

Brow sculpting/shaping - You are going to have to seriously grow your brows out before trying this one.  No joke, don't touch them AT ALL for a few months and then go visit Ursula.  Mine are looking great and she is definitely an expert on the subject.

And conveniently for the restaurant, most of the good sushi is on a red plate. For dinner, however, you get all you can eat, red plates included, for $17.99. And trust me, if you like sushi, you will eat much more than $17.99 worth. And if you don't, they only charge you for how much you ate. 

In terms of food, it's alright. Peter's Sushi in Brentwood is MUCH better. This place is like high end fast food sushi. If you care more about quantity than quality, it's a good place for you.

I decided to go there b/c I saw a coupon in the Santa Barbara News Press for $30 for both a mani/pedi.  Wow!  great deal considering my last mani/pedi here ran me like $54!  Regular mani/pedi ladies, nothing special, no flowers, no acrylics, nope, just a plain mani/pedi.

So I sorta knew where Artistic is located, which, is in a strip mall next to an Albertson's and a Rite Aid?  or was it Long's or CVS?  I can't recall, but a drug store of some sort.  so I rolled up Sat morning, about 11:30, walked in and to my awe and total surprise, I walked into the 80's.  yah, seriously, everything was a shade of pink, the chairs were this nasty flesh colored plastic with these ""crushed flowers"" seat cushions.  can we say N-A-S-T-Y??  really.   the nail polishes were located right at the entrance and I started looking at the nail polishes and this guy comes up to me and i said, I need a mani and a pedi, thank you.  He looks at me and says something.  I wasn't sure what so i keep looking for nail colors, then ANOTHER guy comes up to me and says if he can help me and I'm like, yah, uh, i need a mani and pedi?...  *didn't I already tell someone this??

so he tells me to go to a chair and so there I am and i can't say that i feel like the place is totally clean.  it's sorta has this nasty film stuff on all of the seats that i didn't want to put my purse down... 

I guy starts on my pedicure and of course the first thing he asks me ""are you chinese?""  dude.  why does it matter?  I mean, i know i'm like the only other asian person besides your compadres here, but still does it matter?  so i say yes and yes, with a little aggravation.  

another gal comes up and starts on my manicure and clearly her language ability is a little than the guy doing my pedi, so i ask her where is some good vietnamese food in town and she tells me about Saigon In and Out.  eh.  which, ended up being ok.  see my other review. 

so anyway, i can't say that i recommend this place, and the irony... my mani and pedi was $30 WITHOUT the coupon.  uh... okay?....  The only reason i would go back b/c it's was cheap. 

mani - $10
pedi - $20";18/08/2008 04:33

This is one of few places in center city you can get craft beer for less than five dollars. This place is mostly clean and well kept, and very nicely air conditioned on hot summer nights, something I was grateful
for the night I went.

Along with their own beer they do serve wine and spirits as well, with a reasonable cocktail menu to match. I happened to just stick to beer, and from what I experienced their beer is generally quite typical.

I'll start with the bad; Dark Money, their saison, is extremely forgettable. It is not too spicy or salty like a typical saison, and while it is tart it is not a great specimen. Their oatmeal stout, Belgrave Crescent, starts out well enough but ends on an extremely and uncharacteristic bitter note that left a lingering terrible taste in my mouth.

There is good as well though. The Goldenrye has a nice flavor that is very crisp and has pleasant mouthfeel. Sticky Icky, their double IPA, was probably their best offering. It is slightly sweet but not cloying, and has the perfect amount of kick an IPA should have without being too bitter. 

I would come back here. That being said, I'm not dying to come back here and probably wouldn't go out of my way for more of their brews. If you're in the area and like craft beer, then by all means check it out. There isn't anything extremely unique here, but you might find a decent brew or two on tap.";01/09/2016 14:59

I was not paying attention and took a drink, I almost threw up a little.  There were still bits of dried on food from someone who had been eating and drinking.  Makes me feel ill thinking about it.  The appetizers were dodgy looking cheese cubes with some tortilla chips.
On to dinner.
20 minutes after we were seated they took our food and wine order. 5 minutes later they came with the bread. 20 minutes later they came with dinner. 10 minutes into dinner they came with our wine. Oh, my colleagues glass came with the obligatory lipstick smudge.

All of the delay and only half a dozen people in the restaurant.

A very underwhelming experience

On the weird side, they had all of the rooms around the outside of the building and in the middle they had created a stream environment, including their very own sord of ducks (look it up, a group of Mallards on the ground is a sord. Ya learn something new everyday)

They are the utmost perfection in terms of taste when they are hot, and to dip them in any kind of sauce would be to launch your soul into the deepest pits of flavor despair. So just don't do it. Eat them plain and live with zero regrets.

The lemon pepper wings are the kind of thing you push people in front of trains for, but I'd understand if you did some unspeakable things for a little parm-garlic action. The boneless wings are awesome and typically lack the nasty gristle of other alternatives, but you'll occasionally run into a crunchy rock of breading with no chicken inside - a minor inconvenience for such tasty food.

Unfortunately, our fries and wings came lukewarm from this location, which was basically a major tragedy given how unfathomably awesome their food is. Their paper inserts boast that they don't use heat lamps or bins (AKA: their food is hella fresh), but our to-go order that we were most assuredly early to pick up was stale. Disappointing, given that we had only ordered it about 10-15 minutes prior.

When the food is fresh, you're gonna be all, ""lol buffalo wild WHAT?"", but when it's anything but, expect to be writhing on the ground looking for a fix like a smack addict chasing the dragon - it's just not the same, and the disappointment is soul-crushing.

With that said I have to say that I was impressed with my stay and the level of service I received from The Latham. An additional advantage, they're pet friendly! 

I became concerned that I would miss the check-in window due to my late arrival and decided to call before making the drive to Philadelphia. I was assured that my late check in would not be an issue and upon arriving just before midnight I was greeted by a friendly and efficient doorman who was eager to assist with my bags and valeting my car. The front desk staff was kind and welcoming and the hotel provided flavor infused water in the lobby (the little touches that make a difference). 

The Latham's Rittenhouse Square location is ideal; close to great restaurants, shopping and convenient to Center City. I found the rooms to be clean and spacious with complimentary bottled water and a well stocked complimentary Keurig machine. The iPod docking station was a great addition making charging a breeze. One of the highlights of my stay was the complimentary car service and the driver, Roman. Having the convenience of the car made traveling on a challenging weather day a breeze. Not only is the service available to take you to your destination from the hotel but you can call when you are out to schedule a pick up. Roman was courteous, professional, incredibly friendly and provided a native Philadelphian's view on the ins and out of the city. 

The only downside during my stay were intermittent power issues. Most of the hotel lost power during the first morning of my stay and upon arriving at the hotel that evening power was lost again. I must give credit to the staff who handled the issue expertly. I went to the front desk during the first power outage to ask where in the neighborhood I could find coffee since I couldn't take advantage of the in room Keurig. The staff at the desk provided complimentary coffee from the restaurant without batting an eye. Later that evening when the power went out for a second time shortly after I returned for the evening I questioned the situation. The staff apologized and explained that the issue was not isolated to the hotel, which became evident after looking at he building across the street which also had no power. They took it upon themselves to credit my room for the valet parking during my stay. An incredible job handing a difficult situation!";04/01/2015 05:42

The one nurse / receptionist was really helpful and nice but the other one was useless. 
I got called into the room, the doctor started talking to me and then just walked out while I was in the middle of a sentence and came back with the nurse. He told me something about my age and him not being allowed to be alone so that was a red flag. 
He took the swab and looked at my ears and told me to call in 3 days for the results that was that.
So I called Monday morning to see if they got the results yet and they said no, try calling back ""later than now"" so I called at 7 pm and got a voice mail saying they were closed but their office hours are from 9-9. 

So I called back on Tuesday and they still didn't have the results. So I asked what I should do because I'm not getting any better and the receptionist told me to go see a new doctor.

After browsing through their menu, we decided to order  some authentic dishes: grouper with spicy XO sauce, seafood fried rice with spicy XO sauce, wasabi shrimp, crispy tofu with garlic, baby bokchoy with garlic sauce, sweet and sour chicken, sizzling beef with black pepper, seafood tofu claypot, and beef chowfun.  Yes, we were hungry!  In case you are not aware XO is a cognac brand.

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food there.  Everything tasted good and authentic.  The dishes were not too sweet or salty.  I personally found the crispy tofu, beef chowfun, grouper with XO sauce, and fried rice in XO sauce to be really  exceptional.  The wasabi shrimp is OK.

I'll start with the good. The wings. Borderline legendary when it comes to West Philly Wings. I was almost chewed out by some folks when they found out I live in West Philly and I hadn't had the wings yet. They are good. They come dry, slightly salted, and nicely fried. They don't come off too oily or battered and have a nice crispness to it. They are solid wings but I like a little sauce and wetness personally. 4/5

The hot and sour soup was pretty good too. Had enough sour and mild spice, with a nice mix of bamboo, mushrooms, carrots and water chestnuts. 4/5

Now the not so good. The sesame chicken was more breading than anything, and it's not a good thing when you bite into the food and can't tell any textural difference between batter and chicken. Whether they had better quality chicken before and they're just skimping now, I don't know, but what I do know is this was not good. So not good that we couldn't finish it. I'm not claiming to be a faux Chinese food aficionado but no thank you. Won't be ordering this again here. 1/5

The scallion pancake was also disappointing. It looked and tasted like something we get from the frozen food section in the Asian supermarkets. At least they provided an original sauce that had a nice flavor (soy sauce & garlic). 2/5";05/03/2015 01:27

Mexican style corn.   It comes with 4 small pieces.  Great size appetizer for 2 people.   

Shrimp enchiladas (2 enchiladas).   The only downfall is that it was actually a cheese enchilada with 4 perfectly cooked shrimp on a skewer on top of the enchiladas.  The enchilada was excellent, but we wouldn't have ordered it with the Queso Fundido.";03/09/2018 01:48

The roasted veggie bowl is small. The menu list seasonal veggies along with potatoes, white beans and cheese. I guess corn and kale and red peppers are seasonal? At any rate the bowl is not very impressive. Rice with cooked veggies is what it amounts to. There was an avocado creme and salsa condiment on the side. It made the bowl a tad more tasteful.

Saki made us feel very comfortable, explained in lots of detail how our system works, answered our questions, and gave us helpful advice that I think is also going to save us money down the road.  He is a wonderful communicator.

I had called him around 9:30 in the morning because we'd been meaning to have our central air system inspected due to an odd noise it had started making recently.  I figured we'd have to make an appointment for a number of days out, but he was already out on another service call, and said he could be at our place in an hour or two, if we'd like.  He gave us a call half an hour later with an update on his ETA, and arrived 15 minutes later.  The price he charged for the inspection was remarkably reasonable, especially given how much time he spent explaining everything to us, and we plan to ask him to come back to have the system cleaned after it warms up enough that we switch from heating to air-conditioning.

Not only does it make the experience incredibly obnoxious, but it hurts your waitstaff. No one wants to tip when they sit for 45 minutes+ for a couple eggs, especially when they get no updates of effort to alleviate the situation. By the way, ""it'll be up as soon as possible"" doesn't help.

This experience was a little weird, in that shortly after writing my initial thoughts, the owner came out and apologized for the wait and let us know our food would be out shortly and it would be free.

Now, the food was dynamite. Really lovely. And yes, the wait was brutal and the lack of info for so long of it was unfortunate. But I actually feel like taking care of our entire check was a bit of an overreaction. People will wait for good food. You just have to make the wait enjoyable.

The man who drove us from the airport to our hotel recommended it to us and I'm glad he did. It was less than a 5 minute walk from our hotel. 

You can tell this place gets packed on the regular because we waited about 25 minutes to be seated on a Thursday night. It's spaced out well and there is plenty of seating.

Service was honestly great. They are all very attentive and although it was very busy, they had so many people working that they were able to manage it well. Our server was very friendly and she came to our table at least 5 times though out our dinner. She also gave us suggestions and there is really not a single complaint I can make about her service.

Before you order, they bring these really good red potatoes that they cook in the same water they use for boiling crab and they are seasoned with the same seasoning that is used on some of the seafood. These potatoes were definitely unique from any I've had before and a cool change from having bread before a meal. 

For my meal, I ordered the combo dinner that brought charbroiled oyster, shrimp and catfish. You also have the option to have it fried, which I think would've been better but it's okay. It also comes with a plate of fries, a little coleslaw, cocktail sauce and tarter sauce. All this seafood was just what I was looking for and the meal as a whole hit the spot.

Overall, I have to give this place 4/5 stars because even though the quality of the food isn't amazing (3 or 4 stars), they make up for it with the price, quantity, and service. If you're in New Orleans and looking for a good place to stuff yourself with seafood without breaking your pocket, then come here.

The decor is great, but it was a bit confusing when we walked in, there was no one near the door to greet us, so we weren't sure of  whether we were to seat ourselves or what. So, we grabbed a couple of menus and sat ourselves upstairs.

The servers were friendly & efficient, but the kitchen runners from the kitchen though need to learn their table numbers. The kid brought the wrong table's food to us and because my order resembled one of the sandwiches the other table ordered, the runner left it in front of me. The server realized the error and took the plate to the correct table. Now, I didn't touch the plate at all, but had the situation been reversed, I would have been a bit annoyed being served a plate that had sat in front of a stranger for several minutes. 

We started with the beer cheese and it was disappointing at first. The cheese appeared to be a bowl of cold cheese wiz with some garnish on top. However, dipping into it with the super crispy crostini revealed a rich, steaming hot bowl of creaminess that was delicious! The hubs ordered the fried cod sandwich with a side of gumbo. It was a monster piece of fish! He really enjoyed it. He said the gumbo was good, but not as spicy as he expected with the name gumbo. I had the Burgermeister and oh my it was delish! I had fries as my side and though they were great, the burger was too big to eat very many of them.

Rich and Charlie's has come a long way from their family dishes and family atmosphere to provide you with over priced, bulky plated food, served with whatever the internet radio feels is pop that day. This is a HARD 2 star location and NOT recommended for a good date or meal. Give the Lemay location a shot over this one. 

To reiterate, If you want ok hot food at twice the price it's worth, served to the pop hits of internet radio, this is the jackpot. Looking past it's old timey Italian façade, you will find a local restaurant chain that has traded service for branded salad dressing. 

With multiple waiters walking around and few to no patrons in the restaurant on a Friday night, we received ok service. It's disheartening when you don't really see the waiter except for when you order or are paying. Even better, instead of offering refills on your empty drinks, they will barely notice you're there until they need to smile and show concern just before handing you the check. 

The pasta is watered down, soupy, and nothing to brag about, unless you can eat two pounds of pasta and want to show off. The dishes are quite expensive for their lack of flavor. Bavarian pretzels are frozen. Their sauces are flavorless. 

This Rich and Charlie's location pales in comparison to its former days. You could get a great home cooked meal with excellent service in a family atmosphere. The delicious dishes have been traded in for twice the servings at double the price and little to no flavor.

That'll be the extent of my food review for Port of Call.  After all, it's classified as a bar on Yelp.  

I've had some random conversations with some random people at Port of Call because of the Monsoon.  The last time I made it to Port of Call about 2 years ago.  It was right after the Saints lost to the Dallas Cowboys to end the Saints' perfect season bid during their Super Bowl Championship run season (2009).

***NSFW monsoon induced conversation:***
Dallas fan (1 monsoon in):  ""Who Dat?  We Dat!""

Dallas fan (1 monsoon in, looking at me):  ""We're like the prom queen of NFL teams, everyone wants to be like us because of all the Super Bowls we've won.  Everyone wants a piece of this pussy.  The Saints are just the new kids on the block, who wants to play in the sandbox.""

Me (1 monsoon in):  ""No one wants old pussy!  You're the type of pussy that smells like rusty nickels!  The Cowboys are old pussy, stop living in the past, the Saints are new pussy!""

Dallas fan (1 monsoon in):  *Stares at me, and shocked at the vulgarity of what I just said*  Turns around all quiet.

Bartender got so crunk by what I just said decides to give me 2nd monsoon on the house.  

Feeling bad, I decide to share 2nd monsoon with Dallas fan.

After deciding to get another monsoon the conversation goes something like this I think.

Dallas fan (2 monsoons in):  ""Let's go find some midgets and strippers""
Me (2 monsoons in):  ""Sounds like a great idea, let's go"".

We had one hour before having to return to the USF campus, we were starving and no one was in the mood for fast food or campus cafeteria.  A quick drive down Fowler and low and behold... chinese buffet for UNDER SEVEN BUCKS.  

Why not?

Remember the four of us were very hungry and perhaps thinking along the lines of ""QUANTITY"" in lieu of ""QUALITY"" 

We were greeted by the hostess but before taking a table we checked out the buffet... obviously we weren't in the right mindset to know what we were getting into.  At that moment we all agreed it looked and smelled wonderful.  We accepted a table and made our way to the buffet...

No one finished their first plate and I was the only glutton for punishment that decided to make another plate.  There must be something we like, right?  NOPE, I was very incorrect with that assumption.  

Perhaps someone slipped us something earlier and we hallucinating to think it looked and smelled good.  Maybe our hunger just got the best of us.  Or we just simply screwed up, but what ever it was we knew a great error of judgement had occurred.  What followed that evening was proof of our misfortune (nothing pretty I can assure you).

I was blown away by the Duck Confit Pizza my first time at Nola so this time I decided to try the Shrimp and Grits. I'm sad to say I wasn't really blown away. I love creamy grits, but these were a bit too creamy with not a lot of texture. The shrimp were small and nothing to write home about. My friend had the fried chicken. The flavor was great and the chicken was delicate and juicy the only downside was the chicken's crust. When cutting into the chicken the crust fell off...not  quite the perfect bite you'd expect. If you're a fan of Maryland style lump crab cakes I'd suggest by passing the crab cake app. The Boudin Balls were great and would certainly recommend those. Overall it was a good dining experience.;04/01/2015 01:29

My husband told them it was our anniversary and they upgraded us to a lovely suite and put champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. They went above and beyond to help us and other guests and it was wonderful! Just a few issues...

1) very thin walls/glass. We were on the 19th floor and we could hear trains, motorcycles, music from the lobby bar, etc. Also, we could hear people getting off the elevator and the people in the room next to us had a baby (we have kids, so we get it) but the baby cried from 3:30 am to 5:00 am and we could hear every moment of it. I felt so bad for the child and parents, but I also wished the walls were thicker so that we weren't listening to every moment of the meltdown.

2) the pool is not nearly big enough to accommodate the number of guests the hotel holds. People were laying in the deck, waiting in line for 30 minutes for a drink, servers were slammed and ignoring guests because they literally couldn't handle the crowds.

Portions are big and food quality is TIP TOP.

I rolled in around 9:20 for dinner on a whim.  I was shocked at how nice the venue is.  I sat at the bar, ordered a cool one, and went over the menu.  Looked good, but then the chef

The bar is facing an open kitchen.  Not an open kitchen across the yonder - It's close, in direct line-of-sight.  Very brave for an open kitchen, and I saw nothing there that made me regret seating, which is rare for a production kitchen.  Nothing was held in chafing dishes; everything is made fresh to order.

Food is much better than the hub, and although prices may be comparable, the portions and quality are far better.   I had a mushroom soup (VERY good, and for the quality of ingredients and cooking, a bargain at 6$), and a Las Cruces Salad (or santa fe? I can't recall - the food coma is setting in).  The salad is an unrestrained orgy of fresh fruit and lettuce, a very fresh raspberry vinegarette, topped with chili-crusted grilled chicken.  The chicken was PERFECTLY cooked, very tender, very fresh.  I'd murder to find a mango that perfect at a grocery, and they seem to have them on hand, along with fresh drupes, strawberries, and stonefruits in spades.

Wine pours are generous, service was swift and knowledgeable, and friendly.  Soup came with a quarter loaf of fresh, lightly toasted sourdough and european butter.  (They didn't toot their own horn about the european butter - it was a pleasant surprise.)

Although I sat at the bar, the seating in the back looked good romantic.  

Only drawbacks are:
1. I didn't see any big tables that would accommodate a large group.
2. This place is soon to be very popular, and it'll mean lines.  For now, get in while you can.

An entree off the ""daily specials menu"", a bowl of soup, and a beer totaled up at $25.  You bet your sweet buns they earned a 25% good tip.

Cheers.

Total Women Health & Wellness is a very clean environment with very nice staff (hence the two stars). My insurance changed in January so I could no longer afford my low dose birth control. I asked to be switched to the generic (which the nurse made me look up on my own and spell to her over the phone). They prescribed me the regular dose, so then I submitted a request for my brand name medication to be approved for coverage that Dr. Williams had to sign and fax. It explained what happened when I tried the regular dose, so she knew, unless it was thrown away after they faxed it back to my insurance company. That was declined so I called back and said ""Here's a small list of medications my insurance company will cover. Please prescribe me a LOW DOSE option of one of these. The most important part is LOW DOSE."" Somewhere down the line of that message reaching Dr. Williams ""low does"" was omitted and I was prescribed the regular dose. I vented to my pharmacist about it and he said ""They DO make a low dose version of the generic drug she's prescribing you... it's new so maybe she doesn't know about it. I'll call her and recommend it for you."" As a doctor myself, I was so disappointed with the way this situation was handled. I do the research on what medications are available, and if I'm unsure I call a friend who's a pharmacist. Then I call the patient myself and make sure I understand what they're asking for (i understand my field is a little less demanding than ob/gyn... but still. I never spoke to the doctor once throughout this whole ordeal). I was VERY unhappy with the customer service here and I'm debating on finding another place to go.

And you can either mix and match flavors or keep it to one flavor.  

They also carry a small assortment of paninis, candy, and beverages - including sparkling water, still water, and Italian sodas.  Oh, and their coffee is tops!

Their house salad dressing is one of my favorites and their volcano roll is prepared differently than I've had it at most places and it's the best. 
I've always thought that the hibachi thing was a bit on the gimmicky side. It's something similar to expecting the people at Papa John's to answer the phone with ""Allo...disisa a da Papa John's howa can I helpa you"". Expecting the chef to do the onion volcano seven times a night and be all smiles is bordering on mockery to me and its unrealistic. Give them a break.

When I moved to Nashville 10 years ago my 16 year old Oriental Shorthair was very traumatized and developed IBS. The first vet I took him to was so cold when she told me there was nothing to do but put him down. I then took him to Nashville Cat Clinic. I was so impressed with their kind concerned attitude. They did not downplay the seriousness of his condition, but did give me some hope. Due to their care and several medicines he did live 6 more pain free happy months. When I did have to make the horribly difficult decision to put him to sleep the caring doctors and staff were wonderful and helped to make his passing peaceful. I now have two rescues and for the past five years they yearly go to Nashville Cat Clinic. Everyone there is so nice and they take great care of my babies. Their prices are very reasonable also. I have lived in 4 different states in the last 30 years and their prices are much lower than in any clinic where my cats have been patients. I highly recommend these wonderful caring professionals.;19/08/2015 06:04

It unfortunately fell from grace a few years ago, but has been rescued from impending doom by the fabulous gentlemen of Packrat Louie's. I admire that they strive to keep the name alive with a few nods to the Select of old; the amazing mussels in white wine sauce for example is still on the menu - original recipe from 20 years ago. But they have streamlined the menu and, well, it works! 

I went in for lunch and well, basically I didn't want to leave! The food, amazing, the staff fantastic. The tables are are set in a way that the room feels so comfortable, you can have a real business lunch and have enough privacy that the table next to you won't hear what you are saying! The patio is two tiered and has a real Euro feel (I hear they may be redoing it as well, and that would really notch it up a peg!) The wine list is excellent and has some really, really great picks for excellent prices. 

From a working lunch to a late leisurely 'ladies or lad who lunch'. Quick casual dinner or special occasion night out. Some how Select is one of the few places in Edmonton that you can select (pun soooo intended!) to meet any of these needs and meet them well.

The food was cold and the lentils were super watery with no seasonings. I told the cook and she stated it was watery because we didn't eat with injera. I told her that wasn't the case that we eat Ethiopian a lot and we know how it should taste. I recommend the following for great Ethiopian food. Kaffa Crossing, Ethio, Goji, Dahlak, or Queen of Sheba. They are a 100 times better than this place. The cook at Era needs to be fired because she is Ethiopian but can't cook Ethiopian food.

The Mack is one of my all-time favorite places, mainly because it is like a sports bar/dance club/townie bar all rolled into one.  The mixed drinks are all served in pint glasses, which is dangerously fun. My favorite drink there is the ""Ninja Water,"" which consists of water, berry vodka, and a splash of cranberry juice. Why do they call it the Ninja Water? Because these sneak up on you like a ninja. Pace yourself, I have fallen victim to the ninja water a few times. 

If you like bar food, then the Mack is a good choice. If you are feeling like splurging, opt for the fried pickles, which are fried to perfection and served alongside a creamy ranch. The Mack also has an incredible buffalo chicken sandwich which is fried and served on a hoagie with pepperjack cheese and ranch. Dang. 

The girls that work at The Mack are so friendly and they create awesome drinks. I love to run up to the bar and say ,""surprise me!"" and they always do. Check out their shot menu above the bar for a list of nearly 100 different shots that they know by heart! This place is ideal for bachelorette parties that want to hang out without getting harassed.

I like that their yeasts and hops can be viewed by the customers, so I can see what they have and then find a recipe that uses it (the other store in town keeps their ingredients hidden and inaccessible, you have to ask for what you are looking for).

I'm not a fan of the lines at security these days, but I guess that's every major venue now. I feel like most of the seating areas allow for a good view no matter what unless you're in the nosebleeds. There are plenty of good concession stands.

We couldn't get a reservation (our fault for trying to book last minute on a Saturday night) so we called and asked if the bar was busy at happy hour time. The friendly lady on the phone said it wasn't, but at 7PM (when happy hour ended) the bar would be packed. She was right! We got there around 5:30 and decided to enjoy a couple appetizers and happy hour drinks to take advantage of the happy hour discount. It was dead when we got there. We left close to 8:30 and the place was slammed packed!

The bartender we got was very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and Seafood as well, so it was great chatting with her about selections and what makes Eddie V's so popular and good. 

We really loved the menu.... It was unique and had so many great seafood items on it. They offered some nice looking meat (steak and such) options, but the seafood was amazing, it was hard to pick something! So, we let our bartender pick; she suggested the Red Fish and the Seabass. Both were prepared and plated perfectly! Portion sizes were huge too! The Seabass was the thickest we've ever seen and it was done perfectly!

The shrimp cocktail was really nice! Their ""atomic horseradish"" (which came with the shrimp cocktail) was incredibly tasty and sooo hot! Only suggestion I would have is that they're should give you an empty ramekin to custom-mix your cocktail sauce.

The drinks and the wine menu were just as amazing as the seafood menu! They offered so many good wines by the glass! Their wine bottle selection has all the greats and then some! 

They have an incredible and unique dessert menu as well! Most places have ""typical"" desserts.... Not EV's, they had some unique options that made it very difficult to choose just one. Their Bananas Foster Cake was outstanding!

This was our first visit to an Eddie V's. We live not too far from one in the Northern VA area, but have never gone... We're looking forward to going there now! When we travel, we rarely go to a chain of any kind, we prefer local flavors, but this was truly a delight and well worth the visit!

I would go back, but probably just for drinks/snacks and to sit at the rooftop bar.;23/10/2015 15:23

Steak was my fav! They give you chips and a verde salsa with a little bit of kick to it. After ordering 5 tacos, an order of (3) tostadas, 2 beers, and churros for dessert it was only $23.50.

FRVq_f-qMRWwPjplUl_Crg;IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw;vl4uDnmI6lM9zBcAR--84w;4;1;0;1;"I recently read about Deke's on one of the area food websites.  It's close to home so I figured that this warm weather would be perfect for some outdoor dining and some BBQ.  My trusty dining companion and I schlepped up the hill and saddled up to a picnic table.  While it took a few minutes for someone to actually tend to us, it was quite the experience from that point on.

Deke himself came over and chatted with us, explaining what meats were available and what he personally recommended.  What was most impressive to me was that he wasn't necessarily just telling us to order the most expensive item on the menu - he asked us what kind of food we liked first.  In all of my dining experiences I have never had the chef sit down at my table and ask about my preferences and then make a recommendation based on that.

Our server was a little bumbling, I will admit, and that's part of the reason for only four stars.  He knew the menu, sort of, but got a little tripped up on his own suggestions.  He was nice enough, and I think with time he will get there, but that wasn't our experience.

We ordered the chicken and ribs combo as well as a side of mac and cheese.  DC took on the challenge of eating the half-chicken while I dove into the half-rack of spare ribs.  DC's chicken was amazing.  One of the juiciest pieces of chicken I have ever had.  I thought it was a little charred on the outside, and I could do without the tub of extra sauce on the side, but otherwise it was divine.  To me, the side sauce tasted almost like watered down molasses - not all that pleasant.

My ribs were also quite good.  They literally fell off the bone and had a great smoky flavor.  Also a little charred on the outside, but still amazingly good.

The mac and cheese was really good as well.  The serving size was a little small for the price, but the flavor was good with a little kick of heat.  The only issue I had was that there was a layer of melted cheese on top which made the first few bites a little greasy.  Without that melted cheese, I would have been much more impressed.

As others have mentioned, the cornbread is sweet and moist, and i would welcome that as a bar snack at 1am.  It is delicious.  The drinks, however, do add up.  While there is a special on the menu where you get six tallboys for $12, if you only want one beer with your meal it is about $5 for anything other than bud light.

In all this was a great meal.  I would definitely go to Deke's before I went to the other two BBQ places in Manayunk.  When you can see the man outside next to the smoker, and he comes over and chats with you about what's on the grill, it all adds up to a great experience with some damn good food.";27/05/2011 13:35

The Innovative modular menu and the Americanized Chinese food which was not in anyway authentic but which was appealing. Unfortunately they've gone down the road of pop culture far too much. The last time I went I had Dan Dan noodles which I've had in many restaurants all over the world. Basically it's a slightly spicy ground beef and noodle dish. Pei Wei's version is made with chicken I know that I've had it there before. Only, in its latest iteration it's sweet. This dish is never sweet. And in fact that's the case with their whole menu everything has been sweetened and more sauce been put on it. There are some other touch I don't like for instance if you want water they give you a very small glass. And then there are your fellow diners at the self-service setup station many of which will stand there for a long time hogging the entire setup completely unaware that there's anyone else trying to get in any of the condiments or beverages.

I especially like the VIP area.  There is so much leg room I can stretch out or cross my legs without worrying about hitting the seats in front of me.  The seats are set up in pairs, so it is great for a date night.  I love the ""loveseat"" feeling of the pairs of seats, and it feels like a real luxury to not be crowded next to people you don't know.   I wouldn't recommend it for a group of three though, one person is going to end up feeling separated from the other two.  Both times I've eaten in the theatres, the food has been very good, and not overpriced.  If you want a better menu, order in the area outside the theatres (where the bar is set up).  The menu is whole booklet rather than a single laminated card, and you can ask for boxes to take your food into the theatre if you can't finish it on the plate.

She washed, blow-dried and flat-ironed in 1 hour flat, very impressive! My hair stayed all night, thanks to her! My mom also had a similarly great experience!

Price was good too! $30 for wash, blow dry and flat ironing.

Only down-sider was there were only 3 stylists available when we went, even though we had made an appointment they had already taken walk-in customers (not cool), and my mom had to wait for my hair to be done before she could get hers.

valet was free but tip well!! strangers are driving your car.

when i got to gamble, i came doubled in black jack and that's pretty rare. i also learned how to play paigow. the dealer was very nice when we had questions.

the rooms were nicer than I expected. we had 2 queens and a spacious bathroom. there was plenty of room for 5 people and all our snowboarding gear.

All made in house in a delicious chicken based broth. It has just the right amount of acidity, fat, vegetables are cooked just right. The celery still has a little crunch to it and what a great call to top it with a little cilantro. I may have cut back a little on the salt but realize this is really a personal preference more than anything. It's so good I'm taking a bowl to go. I came in at 1:45 pm so the place wasn't busy which I was looking for. Service was kind. Price was just right at $6/bowl. I am however surprised to read that they have had 5 health inspections violations this year, 2 of them pertaining to soups. It really surprises me about a place like this.

NOLA is a fun place for groups. It's not a place I would suggest for an intimate and romantical dinner, as it's quite loud and there are usually large parties of people seated throughout. It's definitely a fun atmosphere- the elevator ride to the second and third floors is cool (ask to go all the way up and see the wine rooms and they'll definitely show you). 

Bonus for the waiters who lead the ladies to the restroom on their arms. Lovely!  Bonus for the great service, as a team of several people attend to your needs at all times.

There is usually some difficulty during holidays. Tonight, I called for a taxi and after about 10-15 min I receive a text that a taxi is 10 miles away. After about 30 min of receiving the text, I called back to check on the status. The cab was cancelled with no notification. So I reordered a taxi and was told it was not busy tonight and that a cab would arrive in 5-20 min. After waiting another 20 min, I called in to check on the status. I was told the taxi was 1 minute away. After another 10 min of waiting, I called back to check the status and was told the cab no showed. Again with no notification. My boyfriend then ordered a taxi, which did show up, but after waiting over 1.5 hours, my plans completely fell thru. One of their dispatchers, Jennifer, called and left my boyfriend a message about how they called and called and the taxi was waiting. I called the dispatcher about what was going on and to cancel the taxi, who again said that they tried to reach me for the current taxi. I let her know that I had been waiting for so long and that my plans are now cancelled because of the wait. Of course there were no solutions or recourse. I called the taxi back and let him know that I no longer needed their services after waiting for so long and poor communication with the dispatcher. We also tried to reach Jennifer about her message of them calling and calling, to let her know this was after me trying for over 1.5 hours to get a cab. I was prepared and took out cash earlier, in case I ended up in a taxi that at the end of the ride surprisingly(shadily) charged a surcharge for using a debit/credit card. I was a bit apprehensive about Uber but now I will try Uber from now on. Perhaps they will provide better communication and customer service.

I was there 08/02/2013 and I called from the beginning and was coming from Orange County to help my sister in law move back from Santa Barbara. Thought this was going to be an easy experience, but guess what... Uhaul made it the worse experience! I called in to purchase a hitch and have it installed. they said they would be able to do it and have me out that same day and with a box trailer going one way... The moment i got there around 12pm the place was full with customers and there was only one person in the back counter and it was some young white male which was dressed very tacky! he had a string holding up his sagging pants and did not know anything. (Assuming he was a new associate)

By the time i got to the front of the line I told them about me and they said ""You are crazy if we can have the hitch installed today?!"" That got me really frustrated and they said there was 2 cars having their hitch installed and said they can do it the next day! I explained i came all the way from Orange County and missed work for this, I cannot wait another day for this to be installed, especially after i made an appt. Then he show me the hitch and said here you go... WTF??? Then it was all scratched up and paint was missing on some of the hitch so i was over that guy and another guy (Younger mexican guy, assuming who was new also who helped him) I asked to speak to the store manager or the owner. Then Anthony came out 15 minutes later and i told him sorry if you were on lunch or were busy. Then he commented rudely saying ""yeah i was and i really don't want to be up here right now?"" I wrote all of this down at that moment and remember every phrase. (I am a supervisor for a customer service center :) ) Then Anthony gave me an attitude as well saying we can't do anything for me and all his little employees were just laughing and watching us bicker about my situation like it was a comedy show. I felt be little and felt like an idiot! He told me that he can have it installed the next day or even Monday. (2 days later) I even offered if I paid them extra they would install it that day. He laughed and smirked and gave me this jerk response saying we don't do business like that? Then i asked where else can i get this install because its simple and 6 bolts. It would take no longer then 20 - 30 minutes to install. (Watched it on youtube) Anthony made a comment saying you don't know what you are talking about and it takes hours to install? ( gave up at this point with them)

Then i was done with them and we both agreed to give me a discount on the hitch since it was badly scratched and paint was missing on some of it. Then he said to get it installed elsewhere. I just paid for it and said i will be back and i had to drive all around town to find somebody to install it since Uhaul over promised something they couldn't do!!!! I then found a friendly place around the corner which was their competitor. They installed it in 25 minutes and got me on my way! 

Now i got back to the Uhaul location again and dealt with the younger mexican college student this time which i am assuming is new also. This took me about 45 minutes to get back to the front of the line. I then asked I have a reservation for the 6' x 12' box trailer and then he said no you didn't? OMG! I said i was just in here and you guys had it on hold with my hitch trailer! Then he said i remember you and will give you a box trailer that is for somebody else and that just came back. I told him i don't care where he gets it from and i just spent the last couple of hours finding a place to install the hitch since you guys weren't able to do it and lied to me! I then pulled around back the enter way and he got mad at me saying to go through the exit back way? I then told him why? He commented that it is easier to stay away from some of the cameras? I don't know what's going on at this point, but i don't care. This place was shady from the start, but there is more! 

When I hooked up my 2001 Acura MDX to it he then said let's do the paperwork. I didn't think about anything at this moment, but went back inside since there was a line out the door and i wanted out of there. I then Was about to sign and they commented that everything was okay on the box trailer and i said I don't know since you didn't let me inspect it. I then told him i like to inspect the box trailer before leaving and he said ""Fine"" with an attitude and terrible body language.

There was a few hits and scratches and he said don't worry the other location that you are dropping off in Orange County will inspect it and he said it will be okay. I said sure? Then he said ""Yes"" don't worry about it and just tell them it was there already. I am dropping it off tomorrow and see what happens. Seems shady !!!!!!!";03/08/2013 14:53

When we were leaving our place, my fiance looked at me and asked if he wasn't dressed up enough.  He didn't have to worry because once we walked into Kingfish Grill and saw the range from business casual to tshirt and jeans, we knew we were in a good place.  There aren't many places I feel right at home once I walk in, but this is definitely one of them.

You can sit at the bar or at the hightops, booth, table, or outside.  There were quite a few individuals sitting at the bar eating alone.  This is a place I would feel comfortable doing that.  Outside there was live music playing, but we chose to sit inside since it is kind of hot.

I got the Ultimate Fish Sandwich (blackened) and it was delicious!  It satisfied my craving for fish.  The french fries are steak cut (my fiance said they looked like fried apple wedges).  They weren't great, but they weren't bad either.  One of these days I'm going to be strong enough to substitute out fries for something healthy, but it is not that day yet.  My fiance got the Chicken Marsala and got pasta instead of the mashed potatoes and asparagus it comes with.

As I was perusing the menu a waitress gavel a friendly greeting and invited me to sit anywhere I wanted. I went out on the windy outdoor deck and sat down. This is where things went bad. I sat for 15 minutes and, even though numerous wait staff passed me, no one even acknowledged my presence. It wasn't even that busy. I almost left but decided to move to a table at the east side of the patio where I was immediately acknowledged. I ordered the grouper curaçao sandwich, grilled with fries.

We spent the day testing various ""best cheesesteaks"" around the city and Jims was our número uno!

The place is extremely efficient, so know what you want before you get to the front of the line. No more than 30 seconds to place order, pay, receive food. The staff were very nice and playful. 

Now why #1? Well seasoned steak packed to brim, caramelized onions, and cheese wiz that melts throughout and produces a perfectly juicy bite! Personal preference from a girl that loves cheese, add a mix of cheese to ensure you get the gooey cheese and runny deliciousness!

He had pork belly and brisket, with a double mac and cheese side.  We both agreed that everything was fantastic.  The pinto beans were a lot more like baked beans than I wished, but I don't really like baked beans.  No matter, I will get something else next time.  Sweet potatoes were sinfully good.

I am someone who can take a loaf of crusty bread and some cheese make a meal out of it. I think opinions about this place will all be in how or what you order. 

The other thing to bear in mind is that you can buy their bread in the local Kroegers as well as most of the health food stores. I personally LOVE the Tuscan.

The place was modern and edgy, not warm and inviting like I consider many coffee shops.  I think I felt that way because the design was mostly done in wood and metal, and a little concrete, very little color in the mix and no comfy chairs, or bubbly handwriting.  The menu board describes where each coffee available was from and the flavor notes in each with prices displayed beside them.  The cheapest poured coffee was somewhere in the $4+ range for a small cup.  

I'm not sure we were greeted when we walked in because I was too busy trying to decipher the menu board which was less the lattes and specialty drinks and more focused on the pour overs and espresso.  

My husband chose a 1&1 which was an espresso shot in a small cup of pour over coffee which came in at $5.  I didn't realize pour over meant they did it right when you ordered so it took awhile to get his cup ready.  The coffee hit the spot for him and was just what he was looking for.  I like a decent cup of black coffee but it was too rich and bitter for me.  I think he would frequent the place if it were close to home and the price wasn't so much.  

They are a ""mission"" shop raising $ to dig wells in poor countries, which may explain part of the cost.  But $4-5 for a small cup is quite a lot, I think.  I wonder if charging less and having a basket for donations may benefit their project and their shop more.  It may drive more traffic to them anyway.";07/04/2017 23:47

She then proceeded to pass our table and check on a table in the back of the dining room. Then she went to run the check of the first table - next to our cooking food with loads of people walking past. Then she comes back and starts to deliver the food. When I brought up the fact that our food had been sitting there, she failed to apologize just said I didn't know it was there. I refused my meal, 5 others with me took their meals which were already cold. Later a hostess offered to prepare me a new meal and when I declined and asked for the check she left. If you can believe it, we still had to wait for our check. Worst service and even worse attempt at service recovery from the hostess/manager.

I called hours before my appointment to see if I could cancel because I'm am extremely ill.  They did not call me back until after my appointment started to tell me that I needed to cancel 24 hours in advance and they would not honor the group-on.  If they would have called me earlier I would have gone in anyway instead of losing my money and appointment altogether.  So why didn't they call me back in time?  Because Kelly already filled my appointment with another customer.  So she lost no money or time but did will not reschedule with me or honor the group on, because she simply didn't want to.

Spicy chicken on a stick, crab wontons, the eggplant, and bamboo shoots are some of my favorite dishes.  You can now even order specialty dishes from the kitchen in addition to ordering from the buffet classics.  For dessert, treat yourself to the white rabbit milk candy, rice candy (comes with a sticker), or a fortune cookie!

I had been to the Maloney's in downtown Tampa for drinks before and had the wings so I figured it would be similar. 

My husband and I shared a sampler app platter that comes with chicken tenders, potato skins and cheese sticks. It was ok. The strips are small but good, the potato skins could use some salsa with them, the cheese sticks were good. We did get to try two wing sauces with this platter though, the car bomb (which is hot) and the Asian ginger (which has an awesome flavor.) My husband ordered two 5 piece wings so we could try to more sauces, he got medium and hot. The hot was good, I did not try the medium. I would say that the wings were the best thing here and I would recommend getting them. The sauces were all pretty good, the Asian ginger was the best, and the wings were cooked perfectly.  I also ordered a French onion soup, it was just ok.

Service was really good. Our server was very helpful with recommendations and was there when we needed her as well as very friendly.

This is a good place to stop in before a show or if you were going to Painting with a Twist (also in the same plaza). I also saw that they have various specials running during game days so that would be a good time to stop in as well.";02/01/2017 16:19

The restaurant had an intimate atmosphere despite the modern design - a trendy sort of place you would find in Soho NYC. The restaurant was busy and booked so we opted to eat at a bar that had a full service menu. There were lots of interesting items on the menu and there's an economical option to order 4 courses for 30$.

So that's what my wife and I did. I started off with the Acero salad, which is essentially a reinterpretation of a caesar salad with egg and artisan salami-  It was delicious. And the dressing was light, not overwhelming. My wife had the meat and cheese plate, it was good, albeit small in portion.

Next I had the spaghetti, wonderful, but a tad salty. The noodles were freshly made and cooked perfectly, al-dente. My wife had an egg ravioli, which was mouthwatering delicious and velvety rich.  For our entrees, I had the safe yet perfectly cooked flank steak, topped over some spinach. While my wife had the scallops. Both tasted fine but nothing to brag about. For our desert, we both shared our panna cotta topped with fleur de sol and caramel while my wife had hazelnut-stuffed figs.

- Friendly knowledgable staff who are there to help, but don't hover.
- Quality merchandise that is classic and not trendy (OK flannel is in now, but they have always carried flannel)
- Spacious individual changing rooms with lots of hooks and mirrors. 
- Reasonable prices and if they don't have something in the size/color you want, you can order online directly from the store and it is delivered for free!

The burger itself was OK; not life changing but adequate. However, the Hollandaise on it was bland, and the accompanying kale salad left much to he desired. It was fresh, but the dressing tasted of salt and vinegar and not much else. The stuffed French toast was the best dish - the berry compote was not overly sweet, the vegan cream cheese like filling was good, and the pink peppercorns added a nice bite. The vegan scrapple was sagey and tasty. The pancakes were huge- you could feed a small army - but unfortunately not completely cooked. The potatoes were oversalted as well, which didn 't bother me as much since I had the sweet dish. 

The service was friendly if a bit slow - the ""bottomless"" coffee took a long time to come out. The cups are small and despite our obvious placement it was a while before we were offered a refill. I like that their employees are paid a living wage, but it also means they don't make much of an effort. 

For the price, there are other options for vegans. Go to Vedge during happy hour if you're pinching pennies,  Blackbird Pizzeria or Govinda's. Sabrina's and Royal Tavern have vegan options if you must have brunch.";13/07/2014 18:48

I stayed tonight and the experience was completely different. The front desk seemed very uninterested in helping us out.

This time around, nothing. I had booked a room on March 16. I specifically wrote that I would be bringing my dog. When you visit the aloft website, it states how dog friendly the hotel is and how they provide these perks for your pet. I checked in on March 26. An entire 10 days later. I checked in and nothing was ready. I was told they didn't have any dog beds. Turns out they did. So someone brought up 1 dog bed. My dog still had dog bowls missing so I had to call the front desk to ask for dog bowls. They brought up 2 bowls. Still missing the treats and toys. At this point, I'm just tired of calling down for things. The room also wasn't vacuumed. There were crumbs everywhere that my dog was about to eat. 

I was also told that the keyless feature on the app wouldn't work because they were fixing the system. I didn't see anyone fixing anything.

The technician arrived on time and diagnosed the leak from the bottom of the water heater which is not repairable.  Fortunately, I am covered with a Sears service contract which covered the replacement of the water heater.  Unfortunately, that's where the good news ended.  The service tech called in and got replacement authorization and said that  another Sears representative would call me within 2-4 hours to schedule the replacement.  He also left me a ticket number and a 1-800 number to use if I did not get a call back.  Of course, I didn't get the phone call so I called the number he gave me.  After being transferred 4-times over 45 minutes, I was directed to a Sears store which where I was informed that my water heater was not in stock and that it would take over a week to get one in.  Then they would schedule someone to put it in.  So, from the time I initially called Sears to the anticipated time to get the problem fixed is more than 2-weeks.  This means that Sears finds it acceptable for my family to be without hot water for over 2-weeks.  I find this simply unacceptable!  Sears also makes it impossible to elevate issues like this to anyone within Sears management with authority to resolve issues like this; seems like NO ONE in Sears management is willing to get involved when things get difficult.  Again, simply unacceptable.   (Perhaps this is why Sears is going bankrupt?)  This review would be at 1-star except for the excellent initial tech who came out.

I rented a car using zipcar October 20, 2015 and was involved in a hit and run. I was not in the car at the time and filed a police report. When I came back to the car the car mirror was damaged. I contacted zipcar to let them know and they said that the claim would be followed up by a phone call. I never received a phone call, I emailed them checking in on October 27th 2015 letting them know I never got a call but did not hear back. During my initial call letting them know of the accident they told me that there would be a hold on my account until it was resolved but ""if I was able to rent a car then everything was fine."" I naturally assumed everything was ok and since after the hit and run I did use their services. Six months later I get an attempted charge saying I owe the $238.00. I was never called or asked to talk about the claim even after attempting to let them know that no one followed up. Before this event as far as I knew I would be covered especially in the event that someone besides me damaged the car. I have loved using zipcar but if this is how they run their business then why would anyone ever use them? You are basically not covered at all and running the risk of paying high fines for damages you did not cause. I was also never sent an itemized invoice stating that the charges from the auto repair company or what I owed. Which I think is more then fair if they are asking me to pay for damage I did not cause.  This company should not be operating at all unless they offer real insurance coverage to every driver and for every rental. They are misleading in making you believe that you are covered but you are not.";11/04/2016 23:18

I went to this restaurant twice, and I have had fantastic meal both times. 
I had their soup of the day, which was mushroom soup.
It was moderately creamy, did not have the weird after taste of the mushroom,and it was even good after it got cold! 

The Pasta Pillow---mmmmmmmmmm. I wish there were more than 5 pieces on the plate. I could have 20 of them. 

Panini---personally, I wanted a little more of the grilled vegetables, and a little easy on the goat cheese. But overall, the volume was just right, very well nutritionally balanced with salad on the side. 

Pasta with salmon sauce---fresh salmon in the tomato sauce!!!! LOTS of salmon!!!! Tasted Great.

Service was dreadful. I order a soda, server comes back with a water. Okay, not the worst thing in the world. I ask a second time and about 15 minutes pass before my soda arrives. I ask for a refill and the server holds my drink hostage for at least 10 minutes while chatting with a coworker. I almost got up to grab it from her hands. (Btw- they weren't busy)

""Street Corn"" is all the rage. I don't get this? Maybe we had a bad batch? Burnt corn in a bowl with a little cheese was what we experienced. Yuck. 

Split the South Beach burrito with the husband. Guac was tasty but when things come smothered, I get a sense it's an attempt to mask something. Burrito was mediocre at best. 

Tacos were probably the best part. Had the grilled chicken and a bite of the fish tacos.

Our server was out quickly as was one of the co-owners to explain the cocktail menu and the various libations they offered.  The cocktail menu was quite varied and unique, which makes this place all the more special.

I ended up having the Thai Noodle Salad off the sides menu with chicken added.  I was a little apprehensive at ordering a side for my entrée, but the server assured me it would be a pretty decent portion size and she wasn't wrong.  It was enough to fill me and have leftovers.  Although, I asked for chicken to be added, it wasn't just cooked/broiled/grilled and thrown on top.  It was actually marinated and very flavorful and incorporated into the dish quite well.

I went on a Sunday morning shortly after they opened.  There were three people working and one other person waiting ahead of me.  I did not wait long before I was sat at a station with my feet soaking and my massage chair turned on.  I did not have to wait more than 10 minutes or so before it was my turn.  My tech was very throrough.  I have some rough feet due to a lot of running so my feet aren't pretty.  Before my polish was applied I had a sugar scrub applied to my legs below the knee, lotion massage, and a hot towel applied.  This was all part of the basic pedicure price, not any upsale.  My polish was applied perfectly.  I was walked to the dry station and the machine was powered on for me.  I was not pushed extra services or rushed to pay immediately.  While I was not handed an alcoholic beverage like the other salon, my pedi cost $5 less and included the sugar scrub, lotion massage and hot towel.  I would rather have that any day.

We were able to quickly find a table on the patio with their open seating option. This worked well for us for a Tuesday but I can see how this could be very challenging during a busy weekend and having people hover near a table waiting for you to leave. 

Service was slow and it took a while for someone to greet us and get us menus.  The food was good, nothing extraordinary but decent bar food.  My biggest complaint would be that my fiance ordered a Beatbox Samuri. We joked that you pick your beer like you pick your horses at the track, 100% based on the name alone.  The menu indicates it is a lighter beer however the beer that was served to him was a very dark brew. When he questions this, the server said the menu wrong and that someone didn't do their job.  While it was funny, it was also a bit concerning that she was unable confirm that he had the correct beer and basically said someone else didn't do their job so it wasn't her fault. She did offer to get him another beer but he was more concerned with the incorrect menu if that was the case.

We'd definitely go back as it was a nice, laid back atmosphere and the food was good. But I wouldn't wait an hour or stalk a table for it.  My fiance loved the beer so he will be back.

There was no announcement of a delay, nothing, noone. We were all just left wondering if our flight had magically disappeared from the schedule. About 45 min later... Still noone, nothing! Passengers started going to other flights and asking if they could look into it, of course no other united employees could or wanted to help. An HOUR AND A HALF later, still NOTHING! Finally at the two hour mark, they announced the flight had been cancelled and there were no other flights until the next day.

My first sentence leaves a a lot to cover.
Pizza: Thin crust personal pizza. Much like Blaze pizza but their toppings are more adult in nature. Put as many ingredients on the pizza as you want and go sit down to get your pizza delivered.
Chicken wings: wide profile of flavors, traditional and boneless. I would have preferred blue cheese dressing over ranch.
Craft Beers: this was new for me. You are given an electric charm that unlocks each tap on a wall of 30 beer/cider/wine taps. Pour as much as you want and taste as many as you want. The price is per ounce. I got to try beers I would never have selected and found some I really liked.

The lady that answered my phone call however was very rude, and that is why I rank them 3 stars only. It is really very simple (I hope that someone there in Management sees this!), always treat the customer with respect. The customer does not care if you hate your job, or you are having a bad day, or if you are mad at your husband, or if you are very busy. If you don't like providing customer service (for whatever reason) then find another job. Smile and greet customers and give them the level of service that you would like to have. When I recently (today) called for a cake order, the rude lady on the other end of the line kept interrupting me. She also rudely ""corrected"" me several times about their cake. I finally had to tell her to please let me finish what I am trying to say. That finally snapped this she-witch back into reality. Put your desire for excellent baked goods on a scale with your desire for excellent customer service. If your desire for baked goods is heavier than your desire for customer service go to McArthur's. They certainly excel in the craft of producing baked goodies.., if however customer service is of extreme importance to you then avoid this place. I personally do not tolerate bad customer service, and may have to look for another bakery.

**Update: Within 3 hours of me posting this review, their General Manager contacted me and apologized for the bad customer service. The fact that they cared enough to do that prompted me to update my review from a 3-star to a 4-star review. Again, their cakes are excellent!";15/08/2013 20:24

I have been disappointed here many times but, never when the server has been Ron.  

LEAD IN: With my job I have traveled around the world quite a bit over the past 30 years.  I have seen some good places, some bad and some really ugly ones... I have eaten in all three.  My first BJ's experience was in Portland, OR when my boss took treated a few of us to dinner. I noted that they had 57 things on the menu that I liked.... and I am a healthy eater, my unhealthy friends call it finicky.. whatever. I was sold on the place.

Back to Clearwater, FL.   I came here on a first date and my waiter never forgot me or my date.. further more he memorized what I had to eat each time... Now let me say, my visits aren't several times in a week... I get deployed for long periods of time, so this makes Ron's memory all the more impressive.

The menu has changed a good bit over the years but, they still have an amazing selection... enough to keep everyone content... even the finicky guy.

Big enough for a party, plenty of TVs, restrooms are always tidy, parking is plentiful but since it is at a mall near Whole foods, other restaurants that are open after the mall closes and the movie theater.  Parking can be a serious hassle at times.  Having a parking garage in the south/southwest side of the mall would be quite beneficial... even if it was only two floors.  Just an attempt to park double the cars in the same footprint would be nice.

I would recommend this restaurant to others and although this location has messed up my meals 5-6 times and other locations did too... such as Citrus Park, Beaverton, Portland (2X) and Downey, CA (Read my review of that last one) I give  them 4 stars based on Ron being the most flawless server I have experienced ever.

Thanks Ron!

Respectfully I Remain,
John (that works on the Missile Tracker)";25/07/2016 08:53

Had lunch at Caplinger's today with 2 business associates. I have been here multiple times during the lunch hour as is always busy but not ""long wait busy"". They take the order at the counter and then bring the meal to the table. It was about 15 minutes from entering the restaurant to getting the food. 

Caplinger's has a wide verity of seafood and sandwiches that  are not going to be found at many other places. For example, I ordered a shrimp Po boy that was outstanding. (See attached photo) Not like a New Orleans Po Boy exactly but really great none the less. They also have lobster rolls. There are several sides on the menus to choose and today I had the red beans and rice. They were good but I would recommend the fried Okra that I have had in the past.

The prices in my opinion are very good based on the quality of meal you get.

Maybe I caught you at a bad time, but dinner is like your primetime! None of the food was fresh, it had all been sitting out for quite awhile. Anything fried was overly crunchy or practically burnt. Mind you this was like 6pm, right smack in the middle of what should be dinner time. 

And with that East Buffet provided a sore reminder of why we do not normally eat at these kinds of places; just not worth the mediocre, old food and the upset stomach for what it is. My advice is to keep your quality consistent! That's how you keep people coming back.";28/07/2015 15:30

Apparently that's also how it's listed on movie listings as well. But for the record, it's just a theater inside the KOP movie theater.

I went to see Hunger Games on the Imax a few days ago. I've seen other movies on the Imax screen here, but it's been a few years. The tickets were fairly expensive (we pre-ordered the tickets ahead of time on Fandago and spent $40 for 2 tickets). However, the theater is huge, and so is the screen! The volume was a bit too high for me, but my mom enjoyed it (I've always thought she was hard of hearing, guess this proved it!). The screen did offer some fantastic close-ups and I did enjoy it more than a normal movie screen- but I'm not sure the discrepancy was worth the extra price. 

There aren't any close bathrooms behind the ticketing post- there are bathrooms at the end of each hallway. I had to use the bathroom in the middle of the movie, and it involved a sprint down the hallway to minimize missed movie. And while I was using the bathroom, I realized that about 20 ants were running around my feet on the bathroom floor. No exaggeration, and I was slightly grossed out. The popcorn was a bit dry but still good, and like all movie theaters, the sodas and food is ridiculously overpriced.

Overall, it's the only Imax screen in a normal movie theater nearby- so if that's your preference, this is your choice. Some will find the benefits (bigger screen, louder sound, more fun movie experience) outweigh the downsides (more expensive ticket cost, far away from bathrooms). I'd only watch certain movies on this screen, and the rest I'd opt instead for a normal theater.";30/03/2012 14:37

When I initially asked for a quote via email I was met with a very prompt response.  Based on the flat rate fee and the very positive reviews on Yelp (I scheduled back in November 2012 prior to the two other negative reviews showing up), I decided on using Skybox.

About a month before my move, I received information from my new landlord regarding insurance requirements for the moving companies coming into the building.  I emailed Matt with these requirements at which time he essentially told me the property manager understood nothing about moving insurance and there would be an additional $100ish charge for this insurance requirement.  After more back-and-forth, it was determined that he would go to the insurance agency that week to have it situated (this was a Thursday, December 27) and would email me with the updated information.

After a week passed with no response from Matt, I sent a follow-up email (Thursday, January 3) to ensure the insurance would be correct.  Matt responded that he was waiting for other insurance papers to build up to make one trip and ""I'll definitely get over there this week.""  ANOTHER week passes with no insurance certificates so I emailed Friday, January 11 (two weeks from my move date) asking if he had gotten the papers and to let me know if it wasn't possible so I could find another mover before my move on January 25.  After no response again, I finally called on January 15 and Matt seemed clueless on the phone saying he was just getting to the office and would call me back in 15 minutes.  I had to call AGAIN about two hours later since he didn't call back.  I finally got the certificate that day.

Then comes moving day...

They were scheduled (per emails, which I saved) to show up at 9am on Friday, January 25th.  9:30 comes and I've heard nothing, so I call Matt again.  He's ""just getting to the office"" (see a trend???) and will get back to me.

At a little before 10 I get a phone call from Scott (one of my movers) saying they're on their way and that Matt had my move scheduled for the 28th (even though ALL of the emails I have state not only the date, but also that it's a FRIDAY... the 28th is a Monday...)  

Scott and Derek show up in a very nondescript GRAFFITI COVERED truck.  No where on the truck did it say ""Skybox Movers.""  If it were friends of mine doing the move for pizza and beer, I wouldn't have minded; however this is supposed to be a ""professional moving company""?  I was completely embarrassed thinking that would be the first impression my new neighbors got!  (Thank goodness no one seemed to be out)

The only reason this company gets two stars is because of Scott and Derek--they were professional, courteous, and expeditious with the move.  Not once did they complain that this was supposed to be their day off or that it was too cold (under 15 degrees in Scranton and had started to snow by the time they finished).  Another huge plus:  so far I've seen nothing that's been damaged or broken!  Tip to Scott and Derek:  You guys are great!  Find a new employer!!!!!!";27/01/2013 21:23
d7i8fMex2jSm9nfesR4KYA;#NOME?;FNP4tlM-KYf--vTk_Gf9nQ;2;5;2;0;"Eh. I think Sushi Train's problem is that the train is too long and the menu is too big! The sushi isn't BAD...it's just not that high quality. I've been here twice and did the train the first time and the hot dinner menu the second. My train dinner was just OK, but was pretty fun to pull stuff off the train. It ended up being kinda expensive for mediocre sushi, but I had a nice time. 

I opted to try the hot dinner meal the next time and asked our waitress for details regarding a specific tofu menu item (Ma Po) and all she could tell me was that it was a tofu dish with spicy sauce. No other details. So I went for it (was this a mistake? maybe). And, just as she told me, out came a plate with tofu and a red, gelatinous spicy sauce. It was like an entire grocery store block of medium-firm tofu chopped up on a plate with sauce. No vegetables. No frills. Just tofu. With sauce. The tofu was just heated, not pan fried or anything so it was really soft which some people may prefer, but I certainly do not. It was definitely edible. My boyfriend gave me his mushrooms from his Yang's spicy chicken to give me some texture to my mush pile. It just really wasn't my favorite, but it WAS cheap and a huge portion (comes with rice, salad and soup too!), so there's that. 

Additionally, I never got a water refill. The waitresses were nice and all, but really couldn't give us ANYTHING when it came to our menu questions.  The restaurant is huge, which I think might be a detriment. I wish that the train were just a small feature of a great Japanese restaurant, but sadly, that isn't the (refrigerated, sushi-filled) case. Sorry, sushi train, I probably won't be back.";03/08/2013 18:21

The bartenders/waitresses are friendly, but the service isn't the greatest.  The food takes a while to come out, so I'd recommend coming here when you're almost hungry (if that's even possible).

The atmosphere here is great, very relaxed and casual. It can get loud when busy, small space with hardwood floors but it is still comfortable. They'll upstairs is mainly for dining but do have a small bar and the downstairs is the more say party area with a small bar and standing room.
Their beer selection here is great with lots of local craft brews as well as some favorites of most enthusiasts, they also have a nice wine selection.
The food is amazing and the menu is very creative! I have not had anything bad here, neither has any of my family that have come too. I love the mixture of comfort food, Americana classics with a twist like the burgers with beef, bison, lamb or pork ;-) the  appetizers and salads are also amazing!
Lastly the service is great and all the staff is friendly and prompt. They take your orders on an iPhone which takes a little longer than writing but it hits the kitchen immediately and seems to be more efficient.

First of all, avoid going on Mondays and Tuesdays for their half price Sushi.  Be prepared for long waits and bad sushi!  We have been there several times (maybe we are gluttons for punishment) and consistently had bad experience.

Twice we had to wait for an Hour before we were served food.  When checked the status of the order, the owner just sneered at us told us that they were busy. No apologies or even basic courtesy and just rudely being told that they were busy asking us to wait.  The place is busy on Mondays and Tuesdays with their half price rolls which is understandable, but service is the main component that defines a restaurant and that kind of response is unacceptable.  The sushi rolls are mediocre and not worth the discounted prices!  

There are many fine Japanese/Korean establishments serving quality Sushi in the area.

I went and saw Big Hero 6 with my husband and our 3 kids. We LOVED IT! Not only the movie, but the entire experience.

We've wanted to go to Cine Bistro, but they don't allow children to watch movies at Cine Bistro, so this was a win/win for us!

The volume was great! The bass was deep and you could feel it in the seats! Awesome.

The menu was varied, and not too expensive compared to what you might pay at a theater for nachos!

My only real issue is that the bathrooms were FAR from our theater, AND the movie was 15 minutes late in starting. For a family out on a school night that was a big deal.

Our AC stopped working in the middle of a Friday night this summer. I was flying out of town the next day, and we had an open house scheduled for Sunday. Nobody wants to buy a house with a HVAC, and my wife definitely didn't want to sweat out the weekend with our two small children. Not good. 

So I'm scrambling to get someone to help, and with one foot out the door to the airport, I send out a request for quotes to a couple places on Yelp.

He called to let us know he was running a little late -- very considerate! -- and showed up just when he said he would. He diagnosed the problem, had the parts on hand, tuned up the unit, and voila -- everything fixed, just 5 hours after we contacted him. Cold air.

My daughter had a pet rat named Lilly that was almost 3 years old. A few weeks ago we noticed her not grabbing her food with her front paws anymore and she couldn't climb up her walk to get her food. Then we noticed reddish brown liquid on her nose and legs. We thought it was blood but found out it isn't but a liquid that they have and comes out when they are stressed or sick. Well we started hand feeding her and giving her water with a dropper. We then noticed 2 lumps under her front arms. Having had a rat when I was younger I knew it wasn't good and that they were probably tumors. I called another vet to ask about putting her to sleep and they wanted $75.00! That is more than the rat cost. So I looked up rat doctors and found these guys. They only charged us 24.00 and we were allowed back there while they gave her a sleeping gas to calm her down. We then left while they did the injections. They wrapped her up and put her in a small box. They were very kind and gave us plenty of time to say good bye to our little pet. I would pick them to take any other pets we may have in the future. I just hope its for a check up and not what we had to do that day.;10/09/2012 20:03

Now this place was super busy, which was both an annoyance and an indicator that people like this place a lot. The interior is cute and it's got pink chandeliers and nice decoration. It's popularity probably lends to the fact that it's really had to find parking in the tiny lot in front of or behind the store. It also had a long line, but not really a clear pricing menu. There's a coffee menu and one on the ice cream, but none in the baked goods area. And I really don't like being the person who gets to the register and asks a bunch of prices then contemplates what to get, so I'd rather just get 1 thing even though with proper signage I could contemplate and consider more while the line chugs.

Speaking of which, I feel at most bakeries, you order near the counter, then I find it helpful if I want one donut or macaron or cupcake, I can see all my choices at once. Here, you trudge past the case and order at the register, which at a busy time takes forever, and since there's no sign near the register, you just have to remember all the options and flavors so I said one and the guy walked off before I could even say anything else. Oh well.

So I got the salted caramel cupcake, and it was nice, the frosting was sweet and I'd say there was too much frosting due to how rich it was. It was nice but a little on the pricey side.

I worked with some Mexican women who insisted that Rosa's was, hands-down, the best in Tucson. I went with them for lunch one day, and wasn't really that impressed. I've been back a couple of times since, and still don't really get it.
You can get better Mexican on the south side but, for where it is, this is up there with Guadalajara, and, I think, above Casa Molina. Good, but not great.
It's a small place, and I've had really varying service. It seems to be better at lunch.
The salsa, for my tastes, has too much onion and cilantro, but maybe I'm a stupid white boy.
South side Mexican food is also cheaper. Your dinner will run about $8 for a regular plate.
I got an asada chimi on one visit, and the grease made it taste awful. So, buyer beware: Rosa's chimis, not so good. I've also had their tacos and enchiladas though, and liked those. The beans aren't bad either, meaning that they're not canned.
If you want really good Mexican, check out some south side places, Guadajara, or even the places on Saint Mary's and Grande (La Herradura, St Mary's Mexican, etc.) Come to Rosa's if you're in the area.";21/05/2009 14:10

Packed for lunch so we came back for dinner during a recent visit to Clayton. We were seated right away, luckily, because then the crowds showed up and there was a wait!

Large blackboard in the bar area displays specials, events, seasonal beers, etc. Their libation menu is pretty extensive and the craft beer aficionado in our group was impressed with the offering of local drafts.

A couple of us started with the soup of the day - roasted tomato with crispy cheese curds. It was delicious - yes, even the crisp curds. Not even close to canned cream of tomato, thank heavens. It was thick, and rich, and tomato-y with a hint of a smoky flavor coming through. Yum.

If a place is going to call themselves ""5 Star Burgers"", they better rate those 5 stars, right? Well, if these aren't 5 stars, they are pretty darn close. Nice variety to choose from so deciding on which one to try can present a problem.  Lamb? Bison? Turkey? Beef? Veggie? But we faced that challenge head on and decisions made. The Potsticker is a grilled pork that comes with a Vietnamese style slaw (never knew there was such a thing!) and a peanut-hoisin sauce. Since it's  pork, you don't have the option of having it prepared any way except thoroughly done. Oh well. End product: very good and the hoisin sauce added a whole new dimension. Dad's Green Chile Cheeseburger came prepared exactly as requested - medium - and again I say, it was perfect! Picture perfect, in fact. Topped with crispy hatch chilies, pepper jack cheese AND green chile mayo! Ya gotta like green chiles to like this burger. Wonderful! Each bite made the taste buds jump for joy.
If you aren't in the mood for a burger, or meat just isn't your thing - there are hot dogs, fish, grilled cheese and salads to choose from. We did have one who opted for the beet-apple salad. Sadly, the julienned beets weren't pickled so lacked flavor, and the caramelized apples were mushy. Moral: if you go to a burger place, don't order a salad. Lesson learned.

Although the shakes, fountain sodas, floats and ice cream all looked yummy and tempting, we stood firm and decided that would have to wait until our next visit.";13/05/2015 03:06

Two weeks ago, I was driving to work and was at like 65 mph when my car started making this scratching kind of sound at the front. No sputtering, blocking, rumbling noises...just a weird scratchy sound. I got to work, consulted Google, and called my friend who's a mechanic about all the dreaded possibilities it could be. He told me to stick with diagnosing people and he would take a look at it if I ever decided to come up to Chicago. (If you don't see the humor and irony in this, you don't know me very well.).

Fast forward. So I really wasn't as worried because the noise never happened again and my car needed some maintenance anyway so I was planning on bringing it in sometime this month. But today, I started my car down the street and looked in the rearview mirror to see this trail of fluid. Condensation? Fluid leak? I don't know. I'm not a car doctor. But coupled that to the weird scratching noise that may have indicated power steering or braking problems (thanks, Google!), I was worried enough to drive back home and call Sears. I mean, I drive fast, but I'm not THAT stupid; last thing I want is the steering out at 80 mph. 

The conversation went like this (and yes, I do sound stupid):
Me: Hey, so I might have a leak. I'm not sure. There's a trail of fluid down my street.
Mechanic: Ok. What color is it?
Me: Uh, I'm not sure. It just looks wet. But I popped my hood and this container that has pink stuff looks low?
Mechanic: Hm. Well, just bring it in. We'll look at it. 
Me: Like right now?
Mechanic: Yep. 

So I get there, and there's like four other cars in the bay, but they put my car in right away. They take a look and tell me everything is a-ok, but that it's time for my oil change and the power steering fluid is a little low. No leaking though. OH, and that pink stuff is supposed to be at that level because it's coolant and circulates. I mean, who would have thought?! ;) 

So thanks, guys, for not laughing at me. And thanks for getting me in right away. And thanks for being all right with me running out in the bay in flip flops asking  where the coolant level should be and what other weirdo containers I need to look at if I ever need to do something like this again (which I feel like is the equivalent of coming into the OR in flip flops).

It had been about 5 years since I've been here and thought it was time to go back. My, how the mighty have fallen! Started with a round of oysters. THERE WERE PARASITES CRAWLING AROUND INSIDE THE OYSTERS!!! That in itself is absolutely unforgivable, but let's set that aside for a moment and discuss the rest of the food.
The bread was cold. The fish had a couple bones still in it. The shrimp didn't have their shells peeled all the way. Defeats the purpose of eating at an upscale establishment when you have to keep sticking your fingers into a mouthful of food to dig out stray bones and shells. Food was barely warm. Everything was drowned in lemon butter. Literally. Both my and my date's plates were food sitting in moats of half melted butter. Everything was over cooked and over salted. If these were 10.99 dinners from the local Logan's, I'd say ""meh, not very good, but I guess you get what you pay for"", but at nearly $40 a plate this is ridiculous.
And what was the manager's response to the living marine parasites that were crawling around in the oysters? ""Sorry about that, we'll take them off your bill. How about a dessert?"" Are you effing kidding me?!? How about ""We're so sorry there were PARASITES IN YOUR FOOD! Dinner's on us and also next time as well so you'll give us another chance to not serve you food with LIVING PARASITES in it."" I paid $90 for that. I should have thrown a fit, made a scene, and stormed out, but I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Unbelievable. Goodbye forever.
Seriously, pay 20% more and go to Oceanaire a couple blocks away. Heck, pay 90% less and go to Golden Corral, they at least don't have parasites.";04/01/2015 01:18

Trying to opt for something healthy, I ordered a simple turkey sandwich...and at the last minute, thinking aloud, said, ""I'm deciding if I should order a side of mac 'n cheese."" The Shapiro's employee's eyes widened and she nodded emphatically, which was the push I needed, so I caved. And thank goodness...

Perhaps it was just that I was exhausted from lots of traveling over the previous weeks, perhaps I was just starving, but that mac 'n cheese was the best decision I've made in a loooong while. Gooey, cheddar cheesy, and the ultimate necessary comfort food at that moment. I ended up eating the entire side of it (which was quite generous, I might add) and only got a little ways through the turkey sandwich, which I saved (and which was also generously portioned).

I know lots of people are complaining about the prices here, which didn't really phase me; in fact, I'm trying to remember the last time I bought airport food that was NOT overpriced. The sandwich was $9 or $10 I think, though it was large, with lots of turkey in it...and the mac 'n cheese was actually a pretty large serving for only $3 or $4. All good in my book.

Though it is massive and has a ton of different ""fun"" things to do, it's kind of overrun with out of control children.  Also, it's outrageous to get into, ($15 unless you are a citizen of Maryland Heights...ridiculous!).

So, now to describe this fine water park of sorts.  Aquaport was the first of the big pool renovations in St. Louis.  Now, it seems every municipality has their own fancy pool.  Since Aquaport has been around the longest, they have some really different things.  Of course, they have the lazy river, which as I said is overrun with children.  Just try to relax in this thing.  I once even asked the lifeguard to please tell this incredibly obnoxious group of boys away from my friend and I, and he just stared at me like I had six heads.  Great job keeping those kids in control buddy.  They have some decent slides too, fast to slow and the lines are never that bad.  But the best part, they have the big toilet bowl.  Basically, jump in and start swirling around the tube like water in a toilet until it dumps you out the small hole in the bottom and shoot into the pool below.  Talk about water up your nose, but hey it's still pretty fun!

Generally, I like this place.  It's clean and it's well maintained.  I never feel gross getting in the water here, which is certainly a good sign.  However, between the out of control children, the lazy lifeguards and the high prices, I just don't go here all that often.  It simply is not worth it.";20/08/2008 18:04

They do one wedding a day, so you are the ONLY bride.  My friend did an outdoor wedding next to the canal.  It is one of the only outdoor canal locations in the city.  Although there are bystanders walking through, no one was rude or in the way.  We all walked down a LONG flight of stairs...what an entrance!! Amy looked stunning waltzing down the steps.  It was fabulous and breathtaking.  

A cocktail hour was also hosted outside after the ceremony was over and the reception was inside in a large open space with plenty of seating and plenty of room for a dance floor.  It was INCREDIBLE.  The staff was on top of things, well organized and incredibly friendly and helpful.  We got ready in a room that overlooked the ceremony location, so we could see people coming in and taking a seat.  It was very cool.

They set up everything Amy requested just as she requested it.  They were professional, courtesy and extremely organized.  I definitely recommend this as a fabulous downtown Indy location.  It was also nice having everything in one place.

Service-Slow as can be. Me and my husband were the only 2 of 3 customers in this restaurant at the time. There were two people behind the counter but they were very slow to finally acknowledge us. When they finally did, they each took forever to actually make the sandwiches. What's up with that? 2/5

We ordered two of the Vietnamese specialty and I would say yes, it was very good. Perfect mix of meat, veggies, pate and the bread was nice and crunchy. With bahn mi sandwiches, the meat and the pate/mayo mixture means a lot to me. It has to be flavorful without being overly salty and Thuy cafe has it right. Price was perfect too. 4/5

Work on service but bahn mi sandwich was good!";17/03/2016 15:25

I've been to a few in CA and WA and now having it in my city is what's enjoyable. They offer different types of rolls, full menu of Nigiri and sashimi, as well as traditional Japanese food such as teriyaki chicken, steak and udon noodles. With the conveyer belt you just grab which rolls sounds appetizing and what your eyes desire which is pretty convenient. Each plate comes with an average of 4 pieces which allows you to try all the different types of rolls without looking at a menu for what's in it or a picture they love to provide at some places. Came to dine in and hour before close so some of the better rolls weren't rotating when we got there. Perk is they did allow us to order which rolls we wanted that they didn't have on the belt. It was good sushi but I'm sure at a busier time it would of been that much better! They do offer Happy Hour Mon-Thurs from 3pm-5pm with rolls starting at .99 cents. Really hope this place will strive and continue serving sushi with this concept.;19/08/2015 05:23

It was pretty good food, not terrible but the atmosphere was just too crowded and dingy for me. We wanted to eat at the fine dining part but I wasn't really sure how to get into it so we just walked into the ""to-go"" part. There really isn't much room to stand if there's a line and it's really tiny, there are as few seats on the other side but not that many. 

I got the soy ham and egg salad wrap on a chili wrap, I'm not gonna lie, I thought it was real ham and when I took my first bite I thought it was amazing. After eating more and more, I started to not like it was much, I think the ham had a different after taste since it's not really ham. I think the idea of eating the ham again made me a little nausaus. I don't think it's because of the food but just me over thinking it. My boyfriend got the Golden Tofu wrap (I think) with a wheat wrap and I thought that was really good. The rice in it tasted really good. We had gotten the chicken nuggets as an appetizer but it came out half way through our meal so we weren't that hungry to eat it. It tasted and peeled like real chicken, crazy! I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce, which is what they give, but overall those were pretty good. We got ice cream as dessert and it was good! I loveeeeee mint chip ice cream and they had just that.

I know you're thinking so why 3 stars? It's more for overall appearance along with food. I guess I can't expect too much in Philly to be spotless but it is what it is. It was just a little too small and crowded for my liking.";20/03/2011 17:48

I decided it was time to remove three huge Bradford Pears from my front yard. They were very close to my home, and right alongside our electric wires. The trees were at the end of their life span, and hurricane season was approaching, but it was not urgent. Even so, Brian got back to me the same night, a Wednesday, and came out to do an estimate Thursday morning.

There was a Maple in the backyard I had planned to tackle myself, but Brian lumped that into his estimate, as well as the removal of some branches on another Maple that was lying on our roof and shed. We were quoted a lower price for agreeing to keep the wood.

The work was done in its entirety by 1 on Monday. The crew cleaned up everything, and even chopped the firewood we were keeping into small pieces and piled them into neat stacks.

Brian and I did discuss the cash payment and agreed that no money would be paid until the job was done. That seems to be the issue with many of the negative reviews. In addition, we did not have the stumps ground. We were going to pay for that service, and Brian did tell us that someone else would be coming another day to do so, but our gas lines run under the front of our house, so we decided against it for now. 

I'd definitely recommend E-Z Tree Service.";28/08/2017 19:41

They also obscure transit maps with Regional Rail lines. Don't believe me, go to SEPTA_Social on Twitter and run an analysis on their tweets.

Signage at the window level of the MFL and BSL interior that allows anyone with 20/200 or better vision to see the signage (see DC). Blind person walkways (raised paths for those with blind-walking canes to braille boards at a specific levels across-system (see Paris), minimize procurement and maintenance costs with one or two standardized tiles on station walls (see DC), automated recordings for Subways / Buses with meaningful instructions that can be easily heard (put up sound absorption and run some audio engineering - who the knows where Bus 31 goes ... give landmarks) (see London), bi-lingual announcements (see Montreal), train Countdown boards and on-time performance technology (see Copenhagen, Ghent), automated teller and NFC (see NJ Transit), and increase revenue with increased distance reach by having bike racks on trains (see Western USA).

I tried some of their cakes before, but surprisingly they were not very good, especially when considering that they have a chef. And after I tried the dessert sampling that they have on Mondays, I was even more dissapointed. I was provoded a teaspoon amount of bacon ice cream, which tasted not good at all. I filled out the feedback paper and still had to pay $1 for that. Maybe I expected too much as it sounded fancy like chef's kitchen dessert samples.. something like that. 

I like the place for coffee and the atmosphere. However, I have to admit that I have not been impressed with any of their desserts yet.";11/10/2014 05:49

My tastebuds have been so used to chipotle that I forgot what an actual burrito tastes like. My advice to you- BELIEVE THE HYPE.

Nothing could top the look on my face when that chorizo burrito with mole sauce came out to me. (If you've never had mole sauce it's worth trying but mind you it can be spicy)
The service was great. Servers promptly came to our table often to ask if we needed anything- refilled water etc.
I've have been here twice after the UYE (no shame) and I really cannot imagine what I would change. 

Free margaritas and sangria? check
Amazingly fresh food? check
Variety? check
Gigantic portion size? check
friendly service? check
A crazy affordable price? check

The only thing is that there isn't much of an ""ambiance."" I couldn't say ""come here for date night"" or ""office happy hour"" confidently because it's such a tiny place with no real atmosphere one way or the other.
Part of me wishes they had a bigger area or fancy decorations, but personally- I just think that's all part of El Limon's charm.

Great food, affordable prices, at a low-key location.";12/11/2014 14:22

I got the banana foster french toast on the first visit, which was fine but nothing special. On the second visit I got a bowl of gumbo because I was feeling sick and wanted something more soupy. The Gumbo was incredibly salty and had very little in it. It felt more like a soup in how watery it was, but more like a chili in how salty it was (which I've learned is not a good combination). Worse was that it came served with two thin slices of white bread, completely soggy from having been served already in the bowl.

Seriously, though, I came here for a wax procedure, as my regular place was closed for renovations, and my two back-up places were unable to accommodate me, as their waxologists (yep, I just invented that word) were on vacation.

I must say, I was a little hesitant about their organic theme. I always just kind of assumed that you needed chemicals for anything to actually work. You're probably guessing where I'm going with this...but I was wrong!

So, i walked to Tierra Mia (or is it Mi Cumbia? A little confused about the name...), which is a few blocks off Rittenhouse Square. I almost would have missed the brick storefront, since it's in a little residential neighborhood. I was immediately greeted by Sebastian (yes, that's his name! Love it...and he's really cool--I spoke to him on the phone when I scheduled, and then forgot the time of, my appointment.) He offered me a drink, which is almost always the sign of a classy establishment. The place is a little small but definitely cozy and comfortable. A minute later, I met Karina, who is their waxer.

She was very sweet and friendly, but the best part of all is that a procedure which usually hurts a whole lot didn't hurt nearly as much as some of the more expensive Rittenhouse Square spas. I think they use some kind of soy wax, which I assumed would be painful and possibly ineffective, but I was so wrong. The procedure was super-quick and pleasant, and it was about $30 less expensive than the ""high-end"" Rittenhouse places.

All this to say, I found my new wax place! =D I'm still a little hesitant about getting a mani/pedi here, since it sounds like it's a little extra work with the type of polish they use. But considering everything they use is food or smells like it, I don't know if I'll be able to hold out for too long.  My favorite part may be is that it's not so busy and rushed as a lot of RH places. I'll definitely be back!";16/07/2012 13:16

The station are kind of far apart, here is all description of he food...
1.) The Chinese food section had four choices, some Sort of beef lo mien, a fried round dough item and two other unappetizing beef choices. All look like they sat for hours. 
2.) There was a seafood section with small pull and peel shrimp.
3.) there was a spot in the middle w lobster tails, shrimp skewers ( but you had to pay for those! We paid $27 for this buffet!)  this station also had generic veggies like mushrooms, peppers and onions that you could get stir fried, there was no meat or noodles to add.. It was strange.
4.) there was a salad bar. Tiny little buffet dishes ( like if you took enough lettuce for a salad you would take the whole dish  ( remember this was $27)  nothing special just some veggies and one cheese, no tomatoes or feta or meat options.  There was a tomato salad with sliced up string cheese instead of fresh mozzarella. Completely ghetto.  Supermarket salad bars are 5 times bigger with more choices. 
5.) There was an Italian section that consisted of some really oily warm noodles and some pizza ( the pizza was the only thing 'sorta' good in he whole buffet.)   
6.) there was a sliced meat section, the turkey was essentially sliced lunch meat.. When they cut it , it was like ten pieces of turkey slices from a deli all in one chunk.
7.)The dessert bar. I could not find any good food for dinner, and honestly the dessert bar 'looked' good.. So I got a pudding, a cookie and a piece of cheesecake. The cookie was hard and chewy and tasted like plastic, the pudding was not edible ( would not feed it to my dog) and the cheesecake had a 'play doe' consistency, so I played with it.. 

Honestly I am not crazy picky,  I am pretty easy going, but I have NEVER ever had an experience where 98.9% of the food was really REALLY bad, and the service was spotty. If you go this casino, take a lunch/dinner or try to find someplace where the food is edible.";01/04/2014 01:35

The upstairs was about half filled when we arrived.  Our waitress came to take our order and we asked about the size of the pizza.  She suggested that we order 1 app and 1 pizza per couple.  So my husband and I did just that.  She took the orders but did not write anything down.  While waiting for food, two members did not receive their ordered drinks and had to remind the waitress.  The waters were only refilled once, when we had to request after several of us had already finished the glass.  Then when dinner came a different server delivered the pizzas to us but our ordered pizza was not part of his delivery.  Turns out the waitress put the wrong order in. So we had to wait for another pizza to be made.  By the time it was delivered, not only were we starving but the rest of our group had already finished their dinners and the toddler was ready to leave.  The waitress delivered the bill and stated, since you're a party of 6 the tip is part of the bill.  That felt like insult to injury.  She messed things up and she still gets a pretty big tip for doing minimal work, poorly.  It's one thing to make an accident, but she made several missteps and still didn't write down the orders for the other tables.

A $14 manicure (which includes a top coat that seems to last longer than other salons') by Ann comes with a hand & shoulder massage. Although $44 is a bit pricier than many other nail salons in the city, it is worth every penny.

They did a good job on transmission about 15 years ago for me.  But took car in to get transmission and clutch fixed.  They over promised on how long it would take.  First is we will have it out on Friday.  Dropped it off on Wednesday morning .  The test drove and called on Wednesday afternoon to to tell me yep the transmission is making a noise and they would have to pull transmission.  Tell me something I didn't already know.   Friday I had to call to get update which was they found the problem and working on getting parts.   Monday I had to call to get another update as they said 1 day in rebuild shop and 1 day to reinstall.  Said still waiting on part but should have it down by Tuesday afternoon.  Had to call tuesday and  still waiting but should be done my wednesday.  Yep you guessed it I had to call again on Wednesdays and thursday to get update.  No suppose to be Friday morning.

I realize that part supply is out of their hands. But at least provide customer service and provide updates

So while apart I said you might as well put new clutch with it out.  Charging over 700 for clutch.  A 300 dollar part that takes 30 minutes to install with transmission out.   

But not a lot you can do because you can drive off without the transmission.  

Hopefully they we exceed my expectation when I get the car back";14/07/2016 20:24

Friendly staff, reasonably priced service (for the job I was getting done) and done in a fairly prompt manner. I would go definitely back again. Let me make this GENERAL comment: it's probably not a good idea to get your vehicle inspected at a place that also does repairs. This is a conflict of interest. Take your car to be inspected at a place that does inspections only, and then get any needed repairs elsewhere. This is not a comment about this location at all, although they do perform inspections here. This is a general comment for anyone in Missouri.;10/01/2018 02:02

wJWERWb1WEduDNm1HkwLJg;sFZkNjFkg6723Z8nqxUUdw;WE9eOBjx-NRrPzXu_v6BdA;5;1;0;0;"First, some clarity, I have never actually eaten AT this place so my review is strictly based on the food and the service on the phone.

I have eaten Burt's Burgers twice now and this last time the company impressed me so much I decided to review! We were in for the week due to my wife having a minor surgery. Neither of us felt like cooking so we ordered from the ""Doorstep Delivery"" guys. I had the ""Double Barreled BBQ Burger"" The first time we tried the place (ordering the same way) and I was BLOWN away with the flavor! That burger even after delivery was hot and fresh. It had a homemade feel to it, even more so that the widely successful Burger Chain with 5 in their name.  This burger is topped with wonderfully sautéed onions, mushrooms, cheddar cheese and REAL bacon strips and a layer of good southern BBQ sauce. Holy crap! Did I mention how good that was?! When you take that first bite you just know it's perfectly crafted. No condiments needed, promise!
This time around I ordered a Blue Cheese burger. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. You can really mess up a Blue Cheese burger if you are not careful, melting big hunks of cheese is not ideal. This was perfectly executed. The onions once again were also perfectly cooked. My big pet peeve anywhere is when you get onions that are ""sautéed"" and they really aren't. You know what I am talking about. Half cooked, half raw or big chunks of not so carefully sliced pieces that easily fall off your sandwich (of any kind) these are NOT that. These are the kind of onions that seem like they were slow cooked and carefully sliced and simmered. Match them up with perfectly melted blue cheese which seemed to seep into the nooks and crannies of this wonderfully crafted burger and you have what I like to call a MAN meal. (Sorry I know its sexiest but you'll get over it) This place for me makes the kind of burger that will make you pound your chest and make guttural and inaudible sounds while you eat it. It's THAT good.

Now a few words about the level of service you'll get. After more than an hour and a half had gone by since I ordered, we had to pick up the phone to find out where our food was. The delivery folks said they had picked up the order and were on their way to my house. Sensing something was not spot on, we called Burt's. The food was still there and had been made for us over an hour ago. No driver in sight. The nice lady at Burt's said they would remake the entire order for us AND they would take care of calling the delivery folks to find out what was up. This level of service was really impressive since it wasn't them we were actually dealing with. If that is any indication of the service overall, this place is probably amazing to dine at as well as order for delivery. 

Now a small negative, my wife had ordered the California chicken sandwich the first time and it turned her off so much she said she would never order ""that again"" it was really quite dry and not very tasty. 

Overall this place with top notch service to burgers you will tell your friends about has my vote. One of these days I might have to venture out and actually eat there. If I do, I'll write up another review to let you know how that was as well. In the meantime, do yourself a favor, get a burger from Burt's, you deserve it!";29/12/2013 01:12

My husband got the chicken Parmesan and it came with a piece of chicken and mashed potatoes. He was hoping for some kind of vegetable, but he said it was par tasting. We got the food to go, but the restaurant is one of the classiest I have been inside. Slightly overpriced and I wish it came with more sides, so that is why I put 4 stars.;26/06/2018 17:51

What's important here is that I am not vegan, and I'm not going to lie, when she said it was raw vegan (which is not completely true) I was not thrilled that was where we were headed for lunch. 

I'm not going to go into details of decor but it's a small but really cute place. They had a great little menu with some non-raw items but I decided to get the buddah bowl salad. Wow this was seriously good! It comes with spicy/sweet kale, avocado, beets, what I thought to be sauerkraut, carrots and falafel with a seriously yummy dressing. 

I'm not kidding this is only of the best salads I've ever had! And it was huge!! Great combination of flavors- Props to the creator! And the best part is I ate nearly the entire thing and felt great afterwards! No bloat, no overly full/gross feeling! Eating whole foods is really amazing.";25/08/2016 12:46

We've been there once for coffee and ice cream for the kiddos.  Everything was fine, good but not spectacular.  We've returned 2-3 times since however they were closed because of the odd hours.  How can a coffee shop not open until 8:30am most days, 9am on Sat, and no morning hours on Sunday and make it?

Tea was not loose tea it was a tea bag in a tea pot, but the cups were cute.

I am not usually a fan of greens in my smoothies or drinks so I was skeptical Florida the kale, Spinach and chars on top of the movie but honestly all the flavors worked. The fresh coconut flakes were great and with the seeds and granola added the right amount of crunch. I topped it off with strawberries which I found to be a great combination. You can see they use fresh fruit and a lot of it. Although the portion seemed small for $11 at first I was surprised with just how much was packed in the bowl and it served as a great and filling lunch for me. So awesome will definitely be back!

ENMmlsM1hc49DU4tOmVuSg;4RR88XZHdwszLnsxxRBLXg;qee3h7VtquJuvSLJ5RE-HQ;1;0;0;0;This pharmacy is horrible. I have one prescription filled here, well I used to have it filled here. One of my dogs has severe seizure issues and is on 3 medications to control them. Two of the medications I get directly from the vet, one I have to get from a human pharmacy- diazepam. This particular location is so inconsistent on how they fill it, is unbelievable. I can't request a refill online, through the app or the automated phone service. I actually have to call and speak to a person. I understand that this is a controlled substance and an ID needs to be shown to pick it up. Sometimes they ask to see my ID, sometimes they don't. Sometimes I can give the ID number over the phone and they'll fill it and ask to see it when I pick up. Sometimes they don't ask for the ID at any point. Today I tried calling in a refill as my dog had a pretty epic seizure this morning and I was running low on the diazepam (the one medication that actually stops active seizures). I waited on hold for over 10 mins to speak to someone. I was then told that they couldn't refill over the phone as they needed to see my ID. I asked if they could fill it and I'd show my ID when I pick it up- nope, not this time. Doesn't matter that they've done it in the past, I now have to go in, request the refill, show my ID and wait. I just wish they were consistent. It's way too much of a hassle to work with them anymore. I'll give their competitor, CVS a try. I'm done with this place.;14/08/2018 15:49

The homemade brownies with chocolate icing were way too saccharine and nondescript for me, and the jasmine iced tea was way too bitter. I was so excited to find a place in St. Louis that has a lower caffeine version. I'm a big green tea drinker, so if it's not going to be caffeine free (and it never is, unless you get the passion iced tea at Starbuck's or Kaldi's), then I'd love for it to be green tea. But here, no matter how many different times I've ordered it, it tastes as if it's been steeped 18 hours. It's not light and fragrant, but heavy and acrid.

But my friend's turkey sandwich was very good. The atmosphere is quite nice too. We always sit in the back by the coffee beans (from Kaldi's) on the black leather lounge chairs they've got. It's a fun, clean environment in a rehabbed part of Sarah and Laclede in the CWE.";03/05/2008 21:46

We sat downstairs (I was with a smoker friend) and it was definitely smoky and kind of loud with the obvious regulars at the bar.  I was hating the '80s music overhead, but I know that's being picky.  

It's really unfortunate that the non-smoking section is upstairs.  We witnessed someone with a walking disability having to be helped slowly down the stairs by two friends, which seemed ridiculous.  

On to the pie.  We opted for the double crust, for a change of pace.  It did come out looking like a big pie with the crust on top.  The Joanie's veggie was literally crammed with fresh vegs (bonus ponts for summer squash and spinach) which spilled out when you took a slice, and not overloaded with cheese, so it was manageable without being messy.  The bottom crust also held up without getting soggy.  A great pie, to be sure!  They also have a limited but decent beer selection, not relying on just A-B products.";14/05/2010 17:03

Subtly enticing from the outside, the honey inspired atmosphere could easily hang with the center city crowd inside.  Lots of privacy for such a tiny restaurant, many of the tables are booths.

Drink list is large enough, though I didn't feel inspired to order anything.

Here the tapas, as we ordered it, is essentially a deconstructed tasting menu, and the price is in line with that.  It's nice in that you have more control, but it comes at the cost of pacing and size.  I always find it a little intimidating to figure out the right amount to order, and we overshot it a little bit this time.

Bowl of spiced popcorn was a nice starter from the kitchen.

Following was the Chinese 5 spice sweet potato fries, which comes with Red Miso Maple and Sweet Chile Sauces.  Fairly standard fries, but the Miso sauce is excellent.

Hot on its tail was the ""Fire & Ice"", which is chilled king crab with oranges, daikon, white miso-chile mayonnaise, and spicy carrot sorbet.  A little heavy with the mayo, but the flavor was good.  Carrot sorbet works really well.

At this point all of the previously mentioned items were on our table in some partially eaten state.  It makes you feel kind of rushed and cluttered when it's only two people.  Just relax and let us savor it.

After clearing out our backlog, the lamb, cremini mushroom, and escargot skewers wrapped in bacon appeared.  It comes with a roasted garlic aioli dipping sauce that is quite good.  Nothing overly complicated, it's hard to go wrong grilling lamb.

Pan seared arctic char with shredded brussels sprouts, smoked pork belly, and
truffled artichoke emulsion was pretty good.  Pork belly interior was very soft with good flavor to match with the crispy char.  Not bad, but the best was for last.

Beef tenderloin with butternut squash and barley risotto, veal sausage, and barley wine reduction.  Wonderful.  Rich and layered flavor, it has an almost smokey undertone.  One of the better risottos I've had, with the veal sausage in there more to add flavor than to be a primary ingredient.   Tenderloin is perfectly cooked, a five star dish for sure. 

Intermezzo of pineapple sorbet and candied ginger.  Good, but the ginger is so strong and sticky that I started eating around it.

Desserts were pretty exceptional.  Lemon cheese cake with minted pineapple relish, toasted pine nuts, and spiced cranberry coulis.  Butternut squash cake with maple syrup, white miso caramel, toasted sesame, and persimmon ice cream.  Great ending to an excellent meal.

A few of the sauces were a little heavy, but the creativity and flavors make Honey a must try.  One of the best restaurants north of the city.";03/01/2012 15:32

I was then told that the marshmallow fluff had run out...as had the whipped cream. The shop employee cheerfully reassured me: ""We run out of stuff all the time!""

Atmosphere: 
Lobby is huge there is one box office window or 3 ticket machines we opted for the machine. It was easy and fast we had no problems choosing our tickets and seats. The lobby was also very clean same with the theater.

Staff/food:
Both need improvements which is sad we were literally the only people in the lobby yet I received cold corndog bites and the S/O got cold popcorn. We asked for a replacement for the popcorn he brought us back the same container I swear. Fine we took it and proceeded on with our journey. There is only one butter dispenser so be prepared to wait if you go on a busy night. The ticket checker was kind and prompt although again we are the only people there.

Movie:
By the time the movie started there was about 3 couple and 2 groups of other people it was nice. The volume a bit loud but the Imax aspect was great.

Overall:
I'd go back on a week night where I know no one was there because it would be a hassle to go on a weekend. There are no breaks in the seating so if you get a middle seat good luck. If they improved food quality and lack of staff enthusiasm I would definitely give more stars.

They have some kind of confusing buck system where some are used for lotions, and some are used for upgrades. I've asked twice to have it explained, since I can't figure out what I can use for what, and I have both on my account. They seem annoyed at having to explain, seemingly because they don't know either. After asking explicit questions I just gave up both times. 
They also did not inform me that I had an expiring $20 credit (for what, I have no idea. Sigh.) that went along with the package I had purchased, until I asked about it later to see for what I could use it. And I was told ""That had to be used within that month."" 
Well, OK. 
And then there was some kind of bonus buck credit that was included with my all-beds-inclusive package that I tried to use toward a purchase, and they told me it had to be used only for bed upgrades.  Um, my package included all beds.

 At this point, I just pretend the weird bonus buck system doesn't exist. It is the closest tanning salon to my home, but I will be trying one a little further to see how it compares.";24/06/2013 18:53

We went early, so we expected there would be young children (and there were).  We were seated immediately and our server came over quickly.  We told her about a coupon we had and she happily accepted it.  (Free appetizer with two entrees and the appetizer - chicken meatballs in white bean sauce - was DELICIOUS). The service was fabulous for the entire meal.  If our server wasn't walking by, someone else was -- checking up on things, clearing dishes, etc.

The food, as we knew, was good and tasty and the sauce much better than some other Italian eat-in restaurants in the area.  Again, the food was served hot and fresh and on nice dishes with appealing presentation.

My husband was quite pleased with the experience and that really says something.

Keep in mind, this was our only dining-in experience so far.  Hopefully if we choose to go a little later next time, we are just as pleased.  Also since we had a road race the next day, we had not done BYOB.  Next time we will.

I found the service eating in is superior to taking out. In the past we've waited longer than anticipated and been given wrong items in our order on take out.  The eating in experience couldn't have been any different.";08/05/2014 15:34

My friend and I wanted to meet up for a couple apps and a drink and both of us left pretty disappointed. The prices for the appetizers were the most disappointing part. We ordered the warm crab artichoke dip and it wasn't even warm. The bread that came with it was so hard that it cut my friend's lip- it was incredibly uncomfortable to eat. I'd gotten the Thai lettuce wraps before when I was younger without realizing it's just a bunch of stuff on a plate- it makes you think you're getting your money's worth but if you're splitting them with someone, it's silly- it only comes with 5-6 pieces of grilled chicken. We asked for more since there was plenty of lettuce and toppings left but our server was incredibly unfriendly and unaccommodating to our request. We didn't bother getting anymore food since we were both disappointed with the overall experience and quality of our food. Out of all the other places to get yummy apps and cheap drinks, I won't be coming back here.;23/03/2018 19:39

They didn't care and said we were dressed perfectly fine. It was nice and cool inside too.

I had a twist on a Tom Collins which they call a Saint Collins, it was damn good too. The bartender was very friendly and shared a good bit of detail about the area to us.

For an appetizer we shared the wood oven roasted pocket bread which reminded me of naan, very good and you could taste every ingredient to it. I had a cup of the gumbo of the day which happened to be cochon au lait and andouille, it was so good, especially the cochon.

My friend ordered a personal pizza for lunch, he's a picky eater and did not like the sound of the toppings for the veggie pizza but still wanted something. The chef came out the bar and told him what was available, he was very friendly. He wound up with a simple pie with just mozzarella with garlic and roma tomatoes I believe, so boring but it's what he wanted. He said it was good and since he's a pizza connoisseur that's high praise.

I had the shrimp and grits which were among the best I've ever had (nothing beats Charleston for them) my sole complaint was they were too thin and could not easily be eaten with a fork. But there were plenty of tasty fresh shrimp and great bacon.

Unfortunately our stay here last night was very disappointing! Our room was very small for a king room, compared to all the other Hamptons we have stayed at. There wasn't a vent fan in the bathroom! The room it self felt very dated and tired. Almost like a dressed up (cosmetic only) Super 8! Not that Super 8 is bad but I have a certain level of expectations when staying at a Hampton Inn and this one didn't even come close to achieving them. 

So this is by far the biggest issue of our stay was the bed!!!! I have always really enjoyed the beds at any Hampton Inn, always very very comfortable and cozy. Last night I did not get any sound sleep the bed was very very worn!!! Our sheet/bed protector keep falling off because it was so worn out! Of course my husband and I both tossed and turned because the bed was so uncomfortable, so the sheet would keep falling off! I didn't want to sleep directly on the bed itself which seemed to be very old! Both my shoulders hurt very bad from attempting to lay in my side for sleep. It is so disappointing to have such a bad experience at this Hampton because we specifically search for a Hampton Inn when traveling because we know the great quality we will be receiving. This one disappointed. Also my husband brought me coffee (which we have always LOVED!) but it was not good! Seemed watered down or something, just missed the mark.

He also said the gold was 14k white gold and that he made the ring. When I looked at the ring it was clearly marked 18k. But the sign in the window right next to the ring stated it was platinum. The ring's center stone was 1.5 carats with a total of 3.3 carats. They wanted over $14,000 for the ring. I quickly handed the ring back to the crook, I mean, salesman and told my husband that we could leave. Do yourself a favor and avoid this establishment.;19/12/2016 13:57

My chicken was extremely tender, and flavorful! The shrimp was very nicely done also, both dishes were excellent. Service was impeccable, and timely. Some of the best service I have had in quite a while. I asked for a small sample of the Green curry sauce (one of my favorite Thai dishes) and the  waitress brought me a small sample without a problem. It was delicious, and you could taste the various Thai spices and condiments in it. It was not overly sweet like some other places I have been too (Ruby Thai).

I am a native Californian so I can picture it already. ""EY, Waddayanow about steaks?"" Well, l may not know cheesesteaks, but I know what I like. 

I did like the sandwich, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. It had good flavor, and I loved the onions. I ordered it ""wizz, wit"" and I was surprised how FAST they get things done. I also got the cheese fries and a drink. All in all it was around $15 (!) and I ate it right there on the benches. Yes, it was cold with the wind blowing. 

The best way I can describe it is to draw a parallel observation with another LA landmark that people rave and fawn over. King Taco. Sure, they make good food. Sure they serve tons of customers every night and are rather well known. Sure they make GREAT late night stops. However, late night munchies are not really the best way to judge foodstuffs. Perhaps being soaked in booze from late night carousing adds to the overall experience. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just in the same way I like King Taco, I liked Geno's.

I however, have had better cheesesteaks. So far, the best cheesesteak I have had in the US was at Moochie's in Salt Lake City. It is not blasphemy, and it in no way takes Geno's down for what it is. A pioneer in the field of cheeseteaks with a history only perhaps one other restaurant can rival. That rivalry I am sure also adds to the legend. 

Still, 3 stars for the food. -Subject to change based on intoxication-";13/02/2011 17:31

But a friend told me about the $19.20 three course meal in honor of the 95th anniversary of the restaurant, so we decided to check it out.
 The restaurant itself is as gorgeous as ever, a gem of a fine dining establishment. There was a bit of a crowd, so it wasn't empty which is  a good thing. I can't stand sitting in an empty restaurant. The service was good to above average. 
 The $19.20 menu provides a few choices for each course. We both ordered the crab and shrimp cake for an appetizer. It was outstanding, one of the better appetizers I have had in a long time. I ordered the short ribs which were good but not great. The sauce was nice and the presentation was nice with a big Portobello on top which was tasty. But the short ribs were cut in pieces and were found under a mound of mashed potatoes. Nothing at all bad about the dish, it just didn't wow. My lovely better half ordered the fish ( drum I think) with tropical fruit salsa and coconut rice, a much better choice. It was very well prepared, especially the execution of the fish which was perfectly moist, cooked just right. For dessert, I ordered chocolate ice cream which consisted of a very tiny, kid's portion (not much more than a tablespoon )of very good ice cream accompanied by about a teaspoon of whipped cream. The better half again ordered better and got the peanut butter mousse which was a much larger portion and excellent, outstanding in fact.
 So if you're looking for a nice evening at a grand restaurant but don't want to break the bank, come to Broussard's for good meal and overall dining experience during the $19.20 special. And, frankly, you should consider coming after the special is over. The food is that good.";28/07/2015 16:49

A thick roux - our waiter asked me how I liked it and I told him and he asked if I wanted to try something else and he suggested the Gumbo. It was decent. He then came over and said they tasted the chowder and agreed too much roux - I'm not a chef and I knew immediately when I looked at the chowder - my boyfriend had the prime rib sandwich - def not worth 15 dollar price and oh yeah my chowder was 9.50.

This is the best, most authentic Chinese food we've found in Nashville so far, whether you order off the menu or try the dim sum weekend brunch.  

I particularly like the shrimp with mixed vegetables, which is served in a flavorful white sauce made with garlic and sesame oil.  The shrimp is cooked well and the plate is generously portioned.  My husband is partial to the seafood pan fried noodles, which is essentially the dish I described above with assorted seafood and served over a huge pile of lightly fried noodles.  We also very much enjoy their egg drop soup - very tasty without being overly salty, and always served piping hot.

We experienced the dim sum for the first time this morning, and were pleasantly surprised.  After reading many a negative review here on Yelp, we went in expecting the worst.  Instead, we received a nice assortment of hot, fresh dumplings and beef short ribs.  We also could have had some of the noodle dishes, fried appetizers, and desserts that were floating around, though we chose not to.  Our favorite dumpling was the shrimp and pork shumai, served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.  I'm not one to eat pork very often, but did very much enjoy this dish and would order it again (my husband actually ordered himself 2 plates of the shumai and didn't regret it for a minute)!

I will say that while the food has improved dramatically, the service is still lacking and in need of some serious work.  We had to wait 15 minutes for our water glasses to be refilled, the carts did not come around regularly, and the dish we ordered off the menu was cold by the time it reached our table (and served without rice, though the rice was supposed to come with).  I believe this is due to the large space of the restaurant and its many tables, and also the expansive menu and many ordering options.  The servers are very nice and knowledgable, and Jack, the manager, is always extremely kind whenever we're there - but the entire staff needs to be trained to work a bit more efficiently.

Overall, come try the food at Lucky Bamboo.  It IS good food and a place Nashville needs to satisfy us picky former New Yorkers who like our Chinese food.";26/05/2014 03:05

I'm very happy to say that the experience with Enterprise was excellent from beginning to end.  Unlike the other company they did a very thorough check outside and inside before I drove off.  The car provided was clean and equal to what I was driving and recent (2015 I believe), meanwhile, at the other place I got a crappy old and falling apart vehicle.

Everyone I dealt with were professional and very nice.  You only get to make a first impression once and happy to say they didn't disappoint.  I will definitely use them again if I need to rent a vehicle again.

Tip:  Though they offer insurance where it also covers the deductible for $16.99/day, best to just check to see if your own auto insurance company covers you fully and not get it.  
Also make a note of how much gas is in the tank.  Mine didn't have a full tank, so they marked on their sheet where the gauge showed, this way I was only responsible for filling it back up to at least the same spot.";23/04/2016 04:43

At first the clientele outside seemed a bit dubious to be honest (many people just hanging outside by the front door) but once inside the atmosphere was pleasant and it became instantaneously obvious that there would be a huge selection. 

On this particular Sunday evening the price for the Buffet was $10.95 ($19.95 if one opted to eat crab legs).  We each chose the $10.95 option and when the meal was done, we really did not miss having the crab.  

Our first round was dedicated to the raw seafood offerings and sushi.  Steamed shrimp, raw oysters and mussels and various fresh sushi rolls were piled onto our plates (being hungry Ren Faire goers in costume and all).  We each agreed that the shrimp were steamed just right and of a decent size and the oysters were very good (one could get their moneys worth just on a couple of plates of raw oysters, they are that fresh and good).  The sushi was a delight across the board but the mussels were a bit flat and tasteless.

Second round included standard asian fare including ribs, several chicken and seafood dishes and the addition of a beautiful standing carve it yourself pork roast that was delicious.  My companion went for dim sum and she enjoyed every bite.  

Neither of us opted for the Mongolian grill option but it did look good, I will definitely give it a go next time.

The service was plentiful and polite as well as being authentic asian.  The asian tea a bit weak for my taste and the dessert table was just a mirage in the distance because our bellies were so full of the good stuff!  (It did look enticing however, from a distance...I spies some huge cookies that I must try next time.... 

All in all this is a good stop, some dishes better than others as in all Asian Buffets but the good outweighed the not quite up to snuff by a wide margin and there were no really scary or bad dishes at all in our tastings.  

The decor' upon closer inspection could use a bit of maintenance but when you are serving the masses a lot of food at $10 a pop, it is not hard to imagine that the margins can be slim.  An honest hard working and well prepared buffet, really what else can you expect?";01/04/2015 14:32

Evening two of my quick trip to Indy, and I took someones suggestion to venture out by Keystone at the Crossing .  The dining room is pleasant and nicely laid out.  Roomy and not stuffy...casual.

I ordered the Sunday dinner special for $29--a tremendous amount of food for a pittance of what it all would cost a la carte.

I had a rather regrettable calamari--breaded and over-fried--as an additional appetizer.  Couldn't tell if they were calamari rings or bits left over from the deep fryer.  huff

Caesar salad was fine.  The Fillet Mignon was AGAIN undercooked (see my St. Elmo review for further reference), and I had to send it back.  Still wasn't totally done, but I simply ate around the pink part.  Folks, it is NOT difficult to cook an 8 oz. fillet.  They're small, and I had it butterflied.  Shouldn't have been difficult.  Oh well...Indy must not be a ""well-done"" steak kind of city.  My side was horseradish mashed potatoes, which, I kid you not, is my second time in two dinners in a row that I've had horseradish in something.  Generous family-sized portion and not too spicy.  Banana bread pudding was ok...I only ordered it because it was one of the few things on the sampler that had ice cream, and I like bananas.

All in all, not a bad place.  I liked my waiter at Sullivan's who, unlike my waiter St. Elmo, wasn't stuffy or had an irritatingly thick accent.  So with all that in mind, plus the fact that I could get a nicely done steak meal in Indy for less than $30, I'm giving it 4 stars.";10/12/2007 05:38
